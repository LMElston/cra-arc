<h2 id="h1">Requirements for SR&amp;ED / SR&amp;ED requirements</h2>
<p>For your work to be eligible for the SR&amp;ED tax incentives, it must be conducted in Canada and meet <strong>both</strong> of the following requirements:</p>	 
          
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm mrgn-bttm-lg">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">The work must be conducted for  the advancement of scientific knowledge or for the purpose of achieving a  technological advancement</li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">The work must be a systematic investigation or search  that is carried out in a field of science or technology by means of experiment  or analysis</li>  
</ul>
    
<details>             
<summary>What advancement means</summary>
	<p>An advancement is the generation or discovery of <strong>knowledge</strong> that your SR&amp;ED work achieved. This knowledge must advance the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tbslvl">scientific  or technological knowledge base</a> that existed when you started the work. It may be based on a scientific o technological uncertainty that your tried to overcome. </p>
<p>What is important is the advancement in the underlying  science or technology, not how the work advanced your business or business  practices.</p>
<p>You <strong>do not have to achieve your objective</strong> to gain  new knowledge. For example, if your work allowed you to understand that the  idea you tested is not a solution for your situation, this can be considered  new knowledge.</p>

</details>    

<details>             
<summary>What systematic investigation or search means</summary>
<p>The systematic  investigation or search is more than having a systematic approach to your work,  or using established techniques.</p>
<p>It must include  the following: </p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-0">
<dt>A hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The idea that triggers your  investigation to overcome the uncertainty (it may be a possible solution to a  problem, a proposed method, or an approach).</dd>
<dt>An experiment or analysis</dt>
<dd>The experiment or analysis you conduct to  test your hypothesis, which may change or evolve as a result of the testing.</dd>
<dt>Results</dt>
<dd>The results obtained or findings of  the experiment or analysis.</dd>
<dt>Conclusions</dt>
<dd>The  logical conclusions that are based on the results obtained.</dd>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md">Review the legal definition of SR&amp;ED: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines-eligibility-work-sred-tax-incentives.html#id_1">SR&amp;ED is defined in the Income Tax Act</a></p>
		 
		 
<h2 id="h2">Eligible research and development work</h2>
<p>Eligible types of research and development work include the following:</p>
<h3>Basic  research<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Basic research is work that aims to advance scientific knowledge without  a specific practical application in view. It often takes place in laboratories  and may be published in scientific journals.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of basic research</summary>
  <p>An example of basic research is the study of a newly discovered virus to better understand its characteristics.</p>
</details>

<h3>Applied research</h3>
<p>Applied research is work that aims to advance  scientific knowledge with a specific practical application in view.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of applied research</summary>
  <p>An example of applied research would be efforts to develop a vaccine against a new virus by exploiting some identified characteristics of that newly discovered virus.</p>
</details>
		 
<h3>Experimental  development<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Experimental development is work that aims to generate  or discover technical knowledge or know-how in order to develop  or improve materials, devices, products, or  processes. This also includes incremental improvements.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example of experimental development</summary>
  <p>An example of when experimental development could occur might be during the scale up and optimization of processes to enable large scale and rapid production of a vaccine.</p>
</details>
		 
<h3>Eligible support work</h3>
<p><a>Some support work may be eligible if it matches the needs and directly  supports the basic research, applied research, or experimental development work.</a></p>

<details>             
<summary>What  support work means</summary>
<p>Eligible <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spprtwrk">support  work</a> must directly support and be commensurate  with the needs of the basic research, applied research, or experimental  development work. This means it must correspond in the amount, size, extent, or  duration that is needed to carry out the SR&amp;ED work.</p>
</details>
<p>Eligible  support work must be in one of the following categories: </p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Engineering</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Design</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Operations  research</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Mathematical  analysis</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Computer  programming</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Data  collection</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Testing</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-md"></span> Psychological research</li>
</ul>
             
    <details>
      <summary>Example of support work</summary>
      <p>For example, if you are developing a vaccine, you may perform tests on the virus to observe its characteristics. This testing would be considered support work of your basic research.</p>
    </details>
    
  <!--<p> Types  of eligible support work: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a>engineering</a></li>
  <li>design</li>
  <li>operations research</li>
  <li>mathematical analysis</li>
  <li>computer programming</li>
  <li>data collection</li>
  <li>testing</li>
  <li>psychological research<br>
  </li>
</ul>-->
    
  <h3>Work that is not eligible </h3>
  <p>Some work is  specifically excluded from being eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives.</p>
  <p>The following  work is <strong>not eligible</strong> and cannot be claimed:</p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Market  research or sales promotion</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Quality  control or routine testing of materials, devices, products or processes</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Research  in the social sciences or the humanities</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Prospecting,  exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum or natural gas</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> The  commercial production of a new or improved material, device, or product, or the  commercial use of a new or improved process</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Style  changes</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-md"></span> Routine data collection</li>
</ul>
      
<details>             
        <summary>Example of excluded work</summary>
        <p>For example, you may carry out data collection as a routine activity for supporting normal business operations. This routinely collected data may also be useful to your SR&amp;ED work. However, since the purpose of the data collection is to support normal business operations, it is excluded from the work claimed for SR&amp;ED tax incentives.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if data collection is carried out to directly support the SR&amp;ED work, then it would be eligible as support work. This is because it is carried out specifically for the purpose of performing SR&amp;ED</p>
      </details>
