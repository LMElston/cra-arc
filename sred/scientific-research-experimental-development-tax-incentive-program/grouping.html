</ul>
<h2 id="h1">What is an SR&amp;ED  project </h2>
<p>Only SR&amp;ED work can be eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives, but not all the work your business does will be  SR&amp;ED. To claim SR&amp;ED tax incentives, you need to identify your eligible work and then group it into one or more SR&amp;ED projects. </p>
<p> A SR&amp;ED project is a set of connected activities that together achieves the scientific or technological advancement you seek. </p>
<details>             
<summary> Example of an SR&amp;ED  project</summary>
<p>Let's say your business is developing a vaccine for a new virus. Some parts of that development work are directly related to resolving an uncertainty, such as not knowing how the virus reacts. </p>
<p>But other parts of the work do not directly relate to resolving the uncertainty, such as procuring a culture.</p>
<p>Only the activities directly related to resolving the uncertainty, that is, discovering how the virus reacts, would be considered part of the SR&amp;ED project.</p>
</details>
<h3>Lifecycle of an SR&amp;ED project</h3>		 
<p>A SR&amp;ED project starts when you identify the scientific or technological uncertainty. If you find that you have several uncertainties, you may actually have several SR&amp;ED projects.</p>
<p>A SR&amp;ED project ends when new scientific or technological knowledge is gained, whether you were  successful in resolving the uncertainty or not. A SR&amp;ED project may still be eligible even if the results you sought were not achieved.</p>
<p>After you have grouped your work into SR&amp;ED projects, you can then determine the related expenditures that you may claim for the year.</p>
<p>While some SR&amp;ED projects can last several years, you may only claim the expenditures incurred during the tax year for which you are claiming. </p>
<h2 id="h2">How to group your work into SR&amp;ED  projects </h2>
<h3>Different ways to group work</h3>
<p>The first step in grouping SR&amp;ED work into an SR&amp;ED project is to separate work that is done to achieve the scientific or technological  advancement from other work you may have done that is not SR&amp;ED.</p>
<p>Depending on how your business projects are organized, there  are different ways you can group your SR&amp;ED work. </p>
 
<details>             
<summary>What business project means</summary>
<p>The purpose of a business project is to achieve commercial success. The lifecycle of a business project may include many activities, often grouped into different projects, phases, and milestones. </p>
<p>The purpose of an SR&amp;ED project is to advance scientific knowledge  or to achieve a technological advancement.</p>
</details>    
<h3>SR&amp;ED project scenarios</h3>

<img src="test.png" class="img-responsive mrgn-tp-lg mrgn-bttm-lg">             
             
<p> <strong>Scenario 1: All activities in your  business project are eligible </strong></p>
<p>Your entire business project may be working toward achieving an advancement in scientific knowledge or technological uncertainty. This means all the activities taking place would form an SR&amp;ED project.</p>
<p> <strong>Scenario 2: Some activities within a business project are eligible</strong></p>
<p>Your business project may have a mix of eligible and ineligible work.</p>
<p> <strong>Scenario 3: Some activities over several business projects are eligible</strong></p>
<p>Your business may have several projects where eligible work is happening. You can group these activities across your business projects into SR&amp;ED  projects. </p>
<h3>Basic steps to grouping you work into a project</h3>
<ol class="lst-stps">
    <li>
	    <p><strong>Identify the activities</strong></p>
	    <p>Identify all the tasks you carried out that were directly related to overcoming the uncertainty.</p>
      <p>It may include the human resources who carried out the activities, the time during the year when the activities took place, and the materials used to conduct the work.</p>

    </li>
    <li>    
      <p><strong>Include SR&amp;ED support work</strong>  </p>
      <p> You may include all support work that corresponds and directly supports your eligible SR&amp;ED work.</p>

        <details>
        <summary>Types of support work to include</summary>
        <p>Eligible support work may include the following activities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a>engineering</a></li>
          <li>design</li>
          <li>operations research</li>

    </li>
    <li>    
      <p><strong>Exclude activities that are not eligible</strong> </p>
      <p> Exclude any work that is not conducted specifically to  overcome the uncertainty.</p>

        </ul>
        </details>
    </li>
    <li>    
	    <p><strong>Name the project</strong></p>
	    <p>Create a name for your project and note down it&rsquo;s start date and expected completion date. You will need to include this information in your SR&amp;ED expenditures claim.</p>

<h3>Assess the eligibility of your work</h3>
<p>Use the  Self-assessment and learning tool (SALT) to better understand which parts of  your work may qualify as SR&amp;ED work.</p>

<h3>Request a pre-claim consultation (PCC)</h3>
<p><a>Request a pre-claim consultation (PCC) to get support before you submit  your claim. A PCC can help you understand if a specific project is eligible for  SR&amp;ED tax incentives.</a></p>
