</ul>
<h2 id="h1">Identify your allowable expenditures</h2>
<p>You allowable expenditures represent the expenditures you incurred conducting SR&ED work. To claim  SR&amp;ED tax incentives, you need to calculate how much you spent in relation to your SR&amp;ED work during the tax year. This means linking your eligible work to the  expenditures you can claim. <br>
  You may claim the following expenditures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>salary or wages </li>
  <li>materials (consumed or transformed)</li>
  <li>contracts for SR&amp;ED</li>
  <li>overhead and other expenditures</li>
  <li>third party payments</li>
</ul>
<p>You may only  claim expenditures for the year in which they occurred. GST/HST is applicable for all expenditures.</p>
<h2 id="h2">Select the calculation method: traditional or proxy</h2>
<p>To calculate your expenditures  you may use either the traditional method  or the proxy method. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. You  must decide what is most suitable for your business.</p>
            <!--start of proxy-traditional section to move to Overhead-->
<p> Select one method  for the tax year you&rsquo;re claiming. You cannot change the method  after you submit your claim form.</p>
<p>  If you don&rsquo;t  select a method, the CRA will process your claim using the traditional method.</p>
<h3>Using the traditional method</h3>
<p>The traditional  method is the default approach to calculating SR&amp;ED expenditures. It  requires you to specifically identify each overhead cost that was directly related to SR&amp;ED work as "overhead and other expenditures".</p>
<details>             
<summary>Pros and cons of the traditional method</summary>
<p><strong>Advantages of the  traditional method</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Overhead expenditures can be included in the  pool of deductible SR&amp;ED expenditures</li>
  <li>May result in actual overhead and other  expenditures incurred being greater than the prescribed proxy amount (PPA)</li>
  <li>Do not need to calculate the salary base and determine  the PPA in Part 5 of form T661</li>
  <li>Do not need to calculate the overall proxy cap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of the traditional method</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Must specifically identify the overhead and other expenditures that are directly related and  incremental to the SR&amp;ED work</li>
  <li>Can  be complex in certain situations, such as when SR&amp;ED and non-SR&amp;ED work are done in the same facility (for example, shop-floor SR&amp;ED)</li>
  <li>Must  identify (track) and allocate which overhead and other expenditures are for the  SR&amp;ED work</li>
  <li>Must  explain how you determined the amount and provide support for the determination</li>
  <li>The  PPA may be greater than the actual overhead and other expenditures incurred.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<h3>Using the proxy method</h3>
<p>If you choose to  use the  proxy method, you do not need to specifically identify and claim SR&amp;ED  overhead and other expenditures for the tax year. Instead you use a formula based on expenditures for salary or wages to calculate a substitute amount called the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prprxy">prescribed proxy amount</a> (PPA).</p>
<p> This affects how you report SR&amp;overhead and other expenditures for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>salary  or wages for support or clerical staff </li>
  <li>office  supplies</li>
  <li>utilities</li>
</ul>
<details>             
<summary>Pros and cons of the proxy method</summary>
<p><strong>Advantages of the  proxy method</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>No need to specifically identify (track) and allocate overhead and other expenditures for SR&amp;ED</li>
  <li>Investment  tax credit is earned on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prprxy">PPA</a></li>
  <li>Easy  to determine the PPA once you establish the salary base (PPA is calculated in  Part 5 of T661)</li>
  <li>Actual  overhead and other expenditures incurred may be less than the PPA</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of  the proxy method</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The&nbsp;PPA&nbsp;or       any expenditures it represents cannot be included in the&nbsp;pool of       deductible SR&amp;ED expenditures</li>
  <li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#slbs">salary       base</a>&nbsp;must be calculated</li>
  <li>Overall       cap on the PPA may need to be calculated</li>
  <li>the       PPA may be less than the actual overhead and other expenditures incurred </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h4">Materials</h2>
<p>Materials for  SR&amp;ED include all the raw materials, substances, or other items that  compose the body of a thing at a given moment in the SR&amp;ED process.</p>
<p> Expenditures  may include both the cost of <strong>materials consumed or transformed</strong> during SR&amp;ED  work. </p>
<p> If you purchase  materials that you will use later in SR&amp;ED, you may only claim their cost  in the year that the materials are consumed or transformed. </p>
<p> SR&amp;ED  material expenditures may be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>invoice  costs</li>
  <li>custom  and excise duties</li>
  <li>transportation</li>
  <li>other  acquisition costs</li>
  <li>storage  costs</li>
</ul>
<details>             
<summary>What  consumed material means</summary>
<p> Materials <strong>consumed</strong> during SR&amp;ED may be materials that were destroyed or made valueless as a  result of the work.</p>
<p>  They do <strong>not include</strong>: </p>
<ul>
  <li>cleaning  supplies, computer discs, filter papers, lubricants, solvents, acids, and test  tubes (these are considered overhead expenditures) </li>
  <li>measuring  appliances </li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>             
<summary>What transformed material means</summary>
<p> Materials <strong>transformed</strong> during SR&amp;ED may be materials that have been  incorporated into other materials or products that have some value to you or  another party.</p>

<h2 id="h5">Contracts for SR&amp;ED work</h2>
<p>You may claim the  amount you paid or that was payable to contractors or sub-contractors who did  SR&amp;ED work in Canada on your behalf. </p>
<p>  Only claim the  portion of the contract that is SR&amp;ED and do not include GST in your  amount. </p>
<p> You must separate  your contract expenditures between <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#rmslngth">arm&rsquo;s  length</a> contractors and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nl">non-arm&rsquo;s  length</a> contractors.</p>
<p> Arm&rsquo;s length contracts  can be included in the calculation of qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures for ITC  purposes. </p>
<p> Non-arm&rsquo;s length contract  can be included in the calculation of deductible expenditures, but they do not  qualify for an ITC.</p>
<p> Review the  policy: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/contract-expenditures-performed-on-behalf-a-claimant-policy.html">Contract  Expenditures for SR&amp;ED Performed on Behalf of a Claimant Policy</a></p>
<h2 id="h6">Overhead and other expenditures</h2>
<p>This refers to expenses that are not directly related to a  SR&amp;ED project but  are necessary to support the work. </p>
<p>If you chose to use the proxy method, you  do not have to calculate overhead and other expenditures. Instead you calculate  a prescribed proxy amount. </p>
<p> If you chose to  use the traditional method, you must calculate the overhead and other  expenditures you incurred carrying out SR&amp;ED in Canada.</p>
<p>Overhead and other expenditures fall into 2 categories:</p>

<h3>A direct result of doing SR&amp;ED</h3>
<p>Expenditures  that are a direct result of doing SR&amp;ED refers to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Costs that directly relate to doing SR&amp;ED </li>
  <li>Costs that only occur because of doing SR&amp;ED           </li>
</ul>
<p>This  means the expenditure, or a portion of the expenditure, must be directly  attributable to doing SR&amp;ED and would not have occurred otherwise.</p>
<p> Any portion of an expenditure that is <strong>indirectly  related</strong> must be excluded.</p>
<p> If  the expenditure does not allow the claimant to engage in SR&amp;ED, for example  if it&rsquo;s for something that occurred <em>after</em> the SRED is complete, it is not  directly related to doing SR&amp;ED.</p>
<p> There  must be a <strong>direct link</strong> between the expenditure and specific SR&amp;ED work, staff, or equipment.</p>

</details>
    
<p>To  be directly related to doing SR&amp;ED, the expenditure, or a portion it, must  also be an <u><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrmntl">incremental</a></u> expenditure. This means it was only incurred because SR&amp;ED happened.</p>
<p> An  expense that increased because of SR&amp;ED, or would have been less if no  SR&amp;ED were carried out, is generally considered incremental.</p>
<p> If  you chose the traditional method, you must be able to show that the expense  only occurred because of SR&amp;ED.</p>
<p> If  an expense is <strong>not</strong> incremental, it is <strong>not</strong> a SR&amp;ED overhead and other  expenditure -- even if the expense is directly related to doing SR&amp;ED.</p>

<h3>A direct result of providing premises, facilities, or equipment for  SR&amp;ED </h3>
<p>Expenditures  that are a direct result of providing premises, facilities, or equipment for  doing SR&amp;ED include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Costs of the       maintenance and upkeep of premises, facilities, or equipment for doing       SR&amp;ED&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Other costs, or portion       of costs, directly related to that provision that only incurred       because of the SR&amp;ED work</li>

<h3>Overhead and other expenditures outside Canada</h3>
<p>You  may be able to claim some overhead and other expenditures for work done outside  Canada.</p>
<details>
<summary>Support work done outside Canada</summary>
<p> An  expenditure for support work done outside Canada may be deductible as an  expenditure for SRED done outside Canada. </p>
<p> But  it cannot be part of your pool of deductible expenditures or qualified expenditures  even if the work supports a Canadian SRED project. Expenditures for SR&amp;ED  done outside Canada do not qualify for an ITC.</p>

<details>
<summary>Work done outside Canada that is  not SR&amp;ED </summary>
<p> For  work done outside Canada that is not SR&amp;ED but is directly related and  incremental to doing SR&amp;ED in Canada, the following expenditures may be  deducted as if they were incurred in Canada and earn ITC.</p>
<ul>
  <li>the acquisition of       equipment used in SR&amp;ED in Canada</li>
  <li>the acquisition of       materials used in SR&amp;ED in Canada</li>
  <li>training hands-on       employees for SR&amp;ED done in Canada</li>
  <li>visits to foreign       customers for SR&amp;ED done in Canada to update them on the SR&amp;ED       project's status</li>
</ul>

<p>Review: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/third-party-payments-policy.html#s10_1">Third-party Payments Policy, Table  10.1</a></p>
</details>    
<h3>Accepted third-parties </h3>
<p>Third-party payments  may be to an approved association, university, college, research institute, or  other similar organization. Normally, a payment will earn an ITC in the year in  which it is paid.</p>
<p> In some cases a  payment to a Canadian corporation in Canada may be considered a third-party  payment. In this case, the payment will earn an ITC in the year in which the SR&amp;ED/work  is conducted, not the year it is paid.</p>
<p>  Review the list of  approved entities: <u><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/third-party-payments-policy.html#ppx1">Appendix  A – List of approved entities</a></u></p>
<h3>Accepted third-party payments</h3>
<p>Third-party  payments can be direct financial contributions, funding for students or  employees doing the SR&amp;ED, or payments in kind. </p>
<p> You may also  claim a property or service you provide if it is at fair market value. However, expenditures for  capital property do not qualify.</p>
<details>
<summary>If  you pay agricultural check-off dues</summary>
<p> Agricultural  producers can earn an ITC from contributions they make to agricultural  organizations (also known as check-offs) that fund SR&amp;ED.</p>
<p> To qualify as a  third-party contribution: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The  agricultural producer must be a tax payer</li>
  <li>The  organization must have an <u>agent-principle</u> relationship with the producer </li>
</ul>
<p>Farm producers  must file either a <u>Schedule T2SCH31</u> or <u>Form T2038(IND)</u> to receive  an investment tax credit (ITC) on third-party payments (check-offs) made to  agricultural organizations.</p>
<p> They do not need  to file Form T661 or Form T1263 if they are only claiming check-offs for the  tax year.</p>
</details>    
<p> If you made a  third-party payment, you must complete:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1263.html">Form  T1263, Third-Party Payments for SR&amp;ED</a> for each payment and  attach it to Form T661. </p>
