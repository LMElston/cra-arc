 <h2>Instructions for <span class="nowrap">Section 2</span>: Cannabis product <span class="nowrap">inventory – Unpackaged</span></h2>
<p>Details for each unpackaged product should be reported in this section in the unit of measure&nbsp;(kg/units/mg). The ending inventory reported should match the physical ending inventory. There may be situations where a cannabis licensee owns the cannabis and it is reported in inventory, but it is not actually in their possession. The licensee's books and records should support these situations for verification, for example, cannabis products that have been transferred to a third party for sterilization purposes or to another cannabis licensee under an authorized service agreement.</p>
<p>Inventories of all cannabis products are shown in each column and are broken down by the type of cannabis product as follows:</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Dried/Fresh cannabis – Flowering material</dt>
<dd><p>Flowering material means the whole or any part (other than viable seeds) of an inflorescence of a cannabis plant at any stage of development, including the infructescence stage of development. Inflorescence is commonly defined as a combination of the flowers and the ultimate small twigs of the branching system subtending the flowers. This includes what is commonly known in the industry as the <strong>bud</strong> and the <strong>small sugar</strong> leaves or other materials (bracts, stems, etc.). Inventories are to be reported in <span class="nowrap">kilograms&nbsp;(kg)</span>.</p></dd>
<dt>Dried/Fresh cannabis – Non-flowering material</dt>
<dd><p>Non-flowering material means any part of a cannabis plant other than the flowering material, viable seeds and a part of the plant referred to in <span class="nowrap">Schedule&nbsp;2</span> to the Cannabis&nbsp;Act. Inventories are to be reported in <span class="nowrap">kilograms&nbsp;(kg)</span>. Industrial <span class="nowrap">hemp by-product</span> is deemed to be <span class="nowrap">non-flowering</span> material and should therefore, be reported under this heading.</p>
<p>The reporting of unpackaged flowering material and <span class="nowrap">non-flowering</span> material inventory comprises <strong>both</strong>:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    fresh cannabis (freshly harvested cannabis buds and leaves, not including plant materials that can be used to propagate cannabis)
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <p>dried cannabis (any part of the cannabis plant that has been subject to a drying process, other than seeds).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Whole cannabis plant</dt>
<dd><p>The reporting of unpackaged flowering material and <span class="nowrap">non-flowering</span> material inventory comprises both fresh cannabis (freshly harvested cannabis buds and leaves, not including plant materials that can be used to propagate cannabis) and dried cannabis (any part of the cannabis plant that has been subject to a drying process, other than seeds).</p></dd>
<dt>Viable seed</dt>
<dd><p>A viable seed means a viable seed of a cannabis plant that is not an industrial hemp plant. Inventories are to be reported in units.</p></dd>
<dt>Vegetative cannabis plant</dt>
<dd><p>A vegetative cannabis plant means a cannabis plant, including a seedling that has not yet produced reproductive structures, including flowers, fruits or seeds. This would include mother plants, clones, and <span class="nowrap">micro-tissue</span> cultures. Inventories are to be reported in units.</p></dd>
<dt>Pure intermediates</dt>
<dd><p>Pure intermediates are concentrates or resins produced by the extraction or other processing of flowering or <span class="nowrap">non-flowering</span> materials, that are then further processed into a cannabis extract, edible cannabis or cannabis topical product. Inventories of pure intermediates are to be reported in <span class="nowrap">kilograms (kg)</span>.</p></dd>
<dt>Finished cannabis extracts</dt>
<dd><p>Cannabis extracts means cannabis products that are produced using extraction processing or other methods of synthesizing cannabinoids, and may contain carrier or stabilizing substances or flavouring agents. Inventories are to be reported in mg of total <span class="nowrap">THC (mg)</span> contained in the finished (<span class="nowrap">i.e. ready</span> for packaging) product.</p></dd>
<dt>Finished edible cannabis</dt>
<dd><p>Edible cannabis means products containing cannabis that are intended to be consumed in the same manner as food <span class="nowrap">(i.e. eaten</span> or drunk). Inventories are to be reported in mg of total <span class="nowrap">THC (mg)</span> contained in the finished <span class="nowrap">(i.e. ready</span> for packaging) product.</p></dd>
<dt>Finished cannabis topicals</dt>
<dd><p>Cannabis topicals are products that include cannabis as an ingredient, which are intended to be used on external body surfaces <span class="nowrap">(i.e. skin,</span> nails and hair). Inventories are to be reported in mg of total <span class="nowrap">THC (mg)</span> contained in the finished <span class="nowrap">(i.e. ready</span> for packaging) product.</p></dd>
<dt>Opening inventory (line A)</dt>
<dd><p>The opening inventory of unpackaged cannabis products on the return must equal the last reporting period's closing inventory for each respective product. Enter amounts for "Opening&nbsp;inventory" under the applicable columns of <span class="nowrap">line&nbsp;A</span>.</p></dd>
<dt>Additions to unpackaged inventory</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li><strong>Total production</strong>
<p>Enter the total quantity of cannabis products produced during the reporting period for each applicable category of product and in the corresponding unit of measure&nbsp;(kg/units/mg).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flowering material</strong>
<p>All flowering material that has been harvested should be included as an addition to inventory under "Total&nbsp;production." For example, <span class="nowrap">1&nbsp;kg</span> of fresh flowering material is harvested from whole cannabis plants and introduced to the drying process. You should enter&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">1.000&nbsp;kg</span> as an addition to the inventory of total production under flowering material.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-flowering material</strong>
<p>All <span class="nowrap">non-flowering</span> material that has been harvested from a whole or vegetative cannabis plant for further processing or packaging is to be included as "Total production."</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Viable seed</strong>
<p>All viable seeds that are produced during a reporting period should be reported as "Total&nbsp;production."</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Vegetative cannabis plant</strong>
<p>All vegetative cannabis plants, including clones, root cuttings, tissue cultures&nbsp;and seedlings produced during the&nbsp;reporting period should be reported as "Total&nbsp;production."</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Pure intermediates</strong>
<p>All pure intermediates produced during the&nbsp;reporting period through extraction or other processes from the cannabis plant, including industrial <span class="nowrap">hemp by-product</span>, should be reported as "Total production." Inventories should not include any carrier, stabilizing or flavouring agents added to the amounts of pure intermediates produced.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Finished cannabis extracts</strong>
<p>All finished cannabis extracts that are produced during a&nbsp;reporting period should be reported as "Total Production."</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Finished edible cannabis</strong>
<p>All finished edible cannabis products that are produced during a&nbsp;reporting period should be reported as "Total Production."</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Finished cannabis topicals</strong>
<p>All finished cannabis topicals that are produced during a&nbsp;reporting period should be reported as "Total Production."</p>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Quantity received in Canada</strong>
<p>Enter the total quantity of cannabis products received in Canada from other cannabis licensees or industrial <span class="nowrap">hemp by-product</span> received from an industrial hemp grower during the reporting period for each applicable category of product and in the corresponding unit of measure (kg/units/mg). Industrial hemp <span class="nowrap">by-product</span> should be reported as <span class="nowrap">non-flowering</span> material.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Quantity imported into Canada</strong>
<p>Enter the total quantity of cannabis products imported into Canada during the reporting period for each applicable category of product and in the corresponding unit of measure&nbsp;(kg/units/mg).</p></li>
<li><strong>Quantity transferred from vegetative cannabis plant</strong>
<p>Enter the total quantity of additions to the "Whole cannabis plant" category during the reporting period from the "Vegetative cannabis plant" category, in units. These would be the plants that are ready to enter into the flowering phase of the cultivation process. For example, <span class="nowrap">50&nbsp;vegetative</span> cannabis plants are either physically moved to a separate flowering room, or the light cycle is changed to promote flowering. You would add <span class="nowrap">50&nbsp;plants</span> as an addition to inventory on the "Quantity transferred from vegetative cannabis plant"&nbsp;line, with a similar reduction to inventory of <span class="nowrap">50&nbsp;plants</span> on the "Quantity transferred to whole cannabis plant" under the vegetative cannabis plant&nbsp;column.</p>
<p><span class="fas fa-calculator fa-lg"></span>
This addition will only apply to the "Whole cannabis plant" category and should equal the reduction to the <a href="#Veg_plant">Vegetative cannabis plant</a> category in "Quantity transferred to whole cannabis plant."
</p>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Total additions to unpackaged inventory (line B)</dt>
<dd><p>Add the quantities in each column (that is, under "Additions to inventory") and enter the sums on <span class="nowrap">line B</span>.</p></dd>
<dt>Reductions to unpackaged inventory</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li><strong>Quantity packaged</strong>
<p>Enter the total quantity of cannabis products packaged during the reporting period for each applicable category of product in the corresponding unit of measure (kg/units/mg). Cannabis products are considered to be packaged when they are placed in the smallest consumer package (including any outer wrapper, package, box or other container) with all required labels affixed, and that are ready for sale to a consumer. Products do not require application of the cannabis excise stamp to be considered packaged.</p>
<details><summary>Example: (descriptive label here)</summary>
<p>For example, <span class="nowrap">50 kg</span> of dried cannabis produced from flowering material is packaged into <span class="nowrap">1 g</span> containers that are ready for sale to a consumer (with or without the cannabis excise stamp applied). This would be reported as a <span class="nowrap">50.000 kg</span> reduction to flowering material on this line. Similarly, <span class="nowrap">200 containers</span> of cannabis extract each containing <span class="nowrap">200 milligrams (mg)</span> of total THC packaged for sale would be reported as a <span class="nowrap">40,000 mg</span> reduction to finished cannabis extracts on this line.</p>
</details>
<p>Cannabis products that are in any intermediate stage of the packaging process (until placed into the final consumer container, fully labelled) are considered to be unpackaged, and will not be reported as quantity packaged until such time they are fully packaged and labelled for consumer sale.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Quantity taken for further processing or planted</strong>
<p>Enter the total quantity of cannabis products taken for further production or planting during the reporting period for each applicable category of product and in the corresponding unit of measure&nbsp;(kg/units/mg).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flowering material</strong>
<p>All flowering material taken for use in the production process would be included as a reduction on this line. This would include flowering material taken to produce a pure intermediate that will be further processed into another cannabis product, for example edible cannabis. It would not include flowering material taken to produce a product that will be reported in the same category, for example milled product.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-flowering material</strong>
<p>All non-flowering material taken for use in the production process would be included as a reduction on this line. This would include industrial hemp <span class="nowrap">by-product</span> taken to produce a pure intermediate that will be further processed into another cannabis product, for example edible cannabis. It would not include <span class="nowrap">non-flowering</span> material taken to produce a product that will be reported in the same category, for example milled product.</p>
<p>If the distinction between flowering and non-flowering material cannot be made, the product should be included as flowering material.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Viable seed</strong>
<p>All seeds taken and planted should be reported as an inventory reduction under viable seeds on this line. For example, if <span class="nowrap">100 seeds</span> are planted, <span class="nowrap">100 units</span> should be reported under viable seeds on the "Quantity taken for further processing or planted" line.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Pure intermediates</strong>
<p>All quantities of pure intermediates taken for use to produce cannabis extracts, edible cannabis or cannabis topicals would be included as a reduction on this line. For example, if <span class="nowrap">10 kg</span> of cannabis resin are taken and mixed with carrier oil and flavouring to produce a cannabis extract, <span class="nowrap">10 kg</span> should be reported under pure intermediates on the "Quantity taken for further processing or planted" line.</p>
