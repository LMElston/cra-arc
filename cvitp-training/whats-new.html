        <p>Through the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP), community organizations host free tax clinics where volunteers file tax returns for eligible people.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s new for free tax clinics:</p>
<h2>Virtual clinics</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce that we will continue to support virtual clinics for the 2022 filing season.</p>
<p>Virtual clinics provide an option, which follows physical distancing guidelines, for volunteers who want to continue serving their community by helping others complete their tax returns. Additionally, your organization can choose to host a virtual Northern communities clinic that serves individuals residing in northern communities (prescribed zones) within Canada. Any approved <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> organization across Canada, willing to offer tax filing services to northern communities, can now communicate this information in their clinic posting(s) on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program.html" target="_blank">Canada.ca</a></p>
<p>For more information on virtual clinics, please refer to the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers.html#grv" target="_blank">Important note: <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> Virtual clinics – Guidelines and resources for volunteers</a> .</p>

<h2>Tax years accepted by EFILE</h2>
<p>EFILE will accept electronic filing for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 tax returns.</p>
<h2>Important dates for the filing season starting in February 2022</h2>

<p>You must only apply for an EFILE number <strong>if you intend to file returns electronically</strong>.</p>
<p>Volunteers must provide their organization with a valid police records check that has been issued within the last three years if they&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li>plan to paper file</li>
<li>will be handling personal tax information</li>
<li>will be using the Auto-fill my return service</li>

        <p>Auto-fill my return (AFR) is a secure <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> service that can be used to automatically fill in parts of an individual’s federal Income Tax and Benefit Return with information that the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>&nbsp;has available <strong>at the time of filing</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/autofill.html" target="_blank">Auto-fill my return</a> section of the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> site has undergone a transformation this year so be sure to check it out to keep up to date with all the latest improvements.</p>
<p><abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers will continue to have the ability to use the Auto-fill my return service when completing tax returns for 2017 and subsequent years.</p>
<h2>Reminder</h2>
<p>To use <abbr title="Auto-fill my return">AFR</abbr> , you will need a valid police records check. For the purposes of the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> , a police records check is considered valid if it was issued within the past three years. If your police records check was issued more than three years ago, you will require a new one.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you are currently using Windows 11, and you are experiencing problems with Auto-fill my return:</p>
<p>Older versions of UFile relied on Internet Explorer to access <abbr title="Auto-fill my return">AFR</abbr> . However, with the recent release of Windows 11, Microsoft Edge has replaced Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can install the latest update to UFile which has added support for the Microsoft Edge browser. Download the latest update from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ufile.ca/products/cvitp" target="_blank">UFILE</a> <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> by clicking on the tax year. Select the downloaded file, click to install and follow the instructions.</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is no need to uninstall UFile before downloading the file.</li>
<li>The Get Latest Updates or Automatic Updates will not provide the update, you must download it from the website.</li>
<li>This issue mostly impacts users running Windows 11. However, prior versions of Windows (10, 8, 7) may also be affected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2021 version is currently undergoing the certification process and should be available to the public on February 17.</p>
<h2>Multi-factor authentication</h2>
<p>Last year, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> introduced new multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance the security of its sign-in services and the protection of taxpayer information. Please be advised that enrollment in <abbr title="Multi-Factor Authentication">MFA</abbr> is now mandatory for all taxpayers using <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s sign-in services. This includes <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers using the Auto-fill my return or Represent a client services.</p>
<p>Cancelling mandatory enrollment status is no longer permitted under any circumstances. If you want the ability to access any <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> online services, you will need to enroll in <abbr title="Multi-Factor Authentication">MFA</abbr> .</p>
