<h3 id="h-1">When to issue a T4 slip</h3>
<p>You <strong>must </strong>issue a T4 slip if <strong>any </strong>of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>You were required to deduct CPP/QPP, EI, PPIP, or income tax from remuneration paid to your employee </li>

</ul>
<h4 id="h-1-2">Exception</h4>
<p>If you provide <strong>current </strong>employees with taxable <strong>group term life insurance </strong>benefits, you <strong>always </strong>have to issue T4 slips, even if the total of all remuneration paid in the calendar year is $500 or less. If you provide former employees or retirees with such benefits, you have to issue a <strong>T4A </strong>slip.</p>

  <p>Make sure the SIN you enter on the T4&nbsp;slip for each employee is correct. An incorrect SIN can affect an employee's future Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan benefits if their record of earnings&nbsp;is not accurate. Also, if you report an incorrect SIN on the T4&nbsp;slip that has a pension adjustment amount, the employee may receive an inaccurate annual <abbr title="Registered retirement savings plan">RRSP</abbr> deduction limit statement and the related information on the employee's notice of assessment will be inaccurate.</p>
<p>If the individual does not give you their SIN (within three days of starting to work), you must be able to show that you made a reasonable effort to get it. If you do not, you may have to pay a penalty of $100 for each number you did not try to get. If you cannot obtain a SIN from the employee, file your information return, without the SIN, on or before the last day of February. </p><p>For more information about social insurance numbers and information slips, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/penalties-interest-other-consequences/consequences-non-compliance.html">Failure to obtain your employee's social insurance number (SIN)</a>, <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic82-2.html">Information Circular&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">82-2R</span>, Social Insurance Number Legislation that Relates to the Preparation of Information Slips</a> or visit <a href="http://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin.html">Service Canada</a>.</p>

  <h3>Benefits and earnings taxable only in Quebec</h3> 
  <p>Revenu Québec considers certain benefits and earnings to be pensionable earnings for employees working in Quebec. These include:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>employer-paid private health benefit plan premiums</li> 
   <li>assumed earnings—persons 55 years of age or older whose hours of work are reduced by reason of phased retirement may choose, with their employers, to make contributions to the QPP on all or part of the amount of the reduction in remuneration</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/online-services/forms-and-publications/current-details/tp-1015.g-v/">Guide TP-1015.G-V, Guide for Employers: Source Deductions and Contributions</a>, or <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/online-services/forms-and-publications/current-details/in-253-v/">brochure IN-253-V, Taxable Benefits</a>, which you can get from <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/">Revenu Québec</a>.</p> 
  <p>The following examples show how to fill in boxes&nbsp;14 and&nbsp;26 of the employee's T4&nbsp;slip when you provide a benefit or earnings to an employee that is only taxable in Quebec.

    <h4 class="panel-title">Example 1 – Quebec taxable benefit, unpaid leave</h4> 
    <p>Marion works for her employer in Quebec and is on an unpaid leave of absence. Her employer pays $750 in premiums to an employer-paid private health benefit plan on her behalf. Since the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable outside of Quebec, it is not income. When preparing Marion's Quebec T4&nbsp;slip, her employer will leave box&nbsp;14 blank. Since the premiums are QPP pensionable her employer will report $750 in box&nbsp;26, the QPP contributions withheld on the benefit in box&nbsp;17, and fill in any other boxes on her T4&nbsp;slip as applicable.</p>

  <p>If you have a registered pension plan&nbsp;(RPP) or a deferred profit sharing plan&nbsp;(DPSP), enter, in dollars only, the amount of the employee's pension adjustment&nbsp;(PA) for the year. If you have to prepare more than one T4&nbsp;slip for the employee because the employee worked for you in more than one province or territory of employment, report the PA proportionately on each T4&nbsp;slip. If you cannot apportion the PA, report it on one slip.</p> 
  <p>If an employee participates in one or more RPPs or DPSPs, you have to calculate their PA using the <strong>total</strong> amount of all pension credits accumulated by the employee under all these plans for the year.</p> 
  <p>If an employee is on a leave of absence and is still accruing pensionable service or credits under the plan, you must report the PA on a T4&nbsp;slip. This is true even if the employee has no employment income in the tax year. Administrators of multi-employee plans (MEPs) should report the PA for the employee on leave on a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4a.html">T4A&nbsp;slip</a>.</p> 
  <p>Leave box&nbsp;52 blank if the employee participated in your RPP or DPSP and <strong>one</strong> of the following applies:</p>

   <li>the employee, even if they are still a member of the plan, no longer accrues new pension credits in the year (for example, the employee has accrued the maximum number of years of service in respect of the plan)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>Special rules concerning the PA</h3> 
  <p>Special calculation rules apply, in some circumstances, to employees who:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>left your employment during the year</li> 
   <li>are on, or return from, a leave of absence</li> 
   <li>participate in a salary deferral arrangement</li> 
   <li>work for you part-time</li>
