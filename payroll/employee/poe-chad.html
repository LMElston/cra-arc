</div>


<p>When employers pay employment income such as salaries, wages, or commissions, the employee's province or territory of employment (POE) must be determined so that the proper provincial/territorial income tax deductions are withheld. The province of employment is determined by whether the employee physically (in person) reports at the employer's establishment.</p>
<details><summary>What is considered establishment of the employer</summary>

 <ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>An <strong>establishment of the employer</strong> is <strong>any place or premises in Canada </strong>that is owned, leased or rented by an employer where employees report to work or from which employees are paid. For purposes of province of employment, <strong>this does not need to be a permanent establishment</strong>.</li>
	 <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Generally, a home office will not be considered an establishment of the employer. </li>
</ul>
<details class="mrgn-tp-md"><summary>Example</summary>
<p>The place of business for a construction company can be one or more construction sites or the place of business for a carnival can include a shopping mall parking lot. The employee's province or territory of employment would be the one in which the field office or shopping mall is located.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>What do we mean by report to an establishment of the employer <span class="label label-warning">New CRA administrative policy</summary>
<div id="ajax-attached">
<p>When an employee physically reports to work at an establishment of the employer, we consider them to be reporting to an establishment of the employer. There is no minimum amount of time the employee has to report to that place.</p>
<p>Where the employee <strong>never physically reports for work</strong>, they are <strong>also </strong>considered to be reporting for work when the employee can be reasonably regarded as <strong>attached to an establishment of the employer</strong>. <strong>The criteria to determine if the employee can be attached to an establishment of the employer are:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The establishment where the employee would, if there were no home teleworking agreement, physically come to work in person to carry out the functions related to their employment duties. </li>
<li>The establishment where the employee goes or would go, if there were no home teleworking agreement, to physically attend meetings, through any type of communication. </li>
<li>The establishment where the employee goes or would go, if there were no home teleworking agreement, to physically receive work-related material or equipment or associated instructions and assistance. </li>
<li>The establishment where the employee would, if there were no home teleworking agreement, physically come in person to receive instructions from their employer regarding their duties, through any type of communication. </li>
<li>The establishment from which the employee is hired, as indicated in the employment contract or letter of offer. </li>
<li>The nature of the duties performed by the employee. </li>
</ol>
<p>The criteria are listed in order of their relative importance.</p>
<p>If an employee neither reports physically to an establishment of their employer or can be considered attached to one of their employer's establishments, they are considered to not report to an establishment of the employer. </p>
