<p>You may provide your employees with benefits (directly or indirectly), in the form of cash, goods, services, allowances, or reimbursements.</p>

<p>You need to consider multiple factors to determine if the primary beneficiary of the benefit is the employer or the employee.</p>

<h2 id="h-2">Analyze the facts</h2> 
<p>You need to analyze the facts by organizing and assessing the information you gathered. This process will move the worker into one side of the continuum, and confirm if the employee or the employer is the primary beneficiary of the benefit.</p>
<p>You must analyze the answer to each question from both the employee <strong>and </strong>the employer to help you decide if the evidence moves the employee or the employer is the primary beneficiary of the benefit side of the continuum.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><span class="fas fa-hand-holding-usd text-primary fa-2x"> </span> Employee is the primary beneficiary</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><span class="fas fa-user-tie text-primary fa-2x"> </span>  Employer is the primary beneficiary</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="h_0_1">Weighing the facts</h3>
<p>This is the most important part of analyzing the information. When reviewing the factors, there may be some facts that support the benefit is taxable or not.</p>
<h3 id="h_0_2">Case-by-case basis</h3>
<p>Whether the employee or the employer is the primary beneficiary of the benefit needs to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Each case is unique and requires a thorough review of the facts. It is also important to remember that when attempting to move the employee or the employer as the primary beneficiary of the benefit to one side of the continuum or the other, you must examine all factors. There is no one factor that is determinative, and there is a non-exhaustive list of factors to consider.</p>
