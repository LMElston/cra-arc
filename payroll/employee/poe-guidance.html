<h4 id="h-facts">Analyze the facts</h4> 
<p>You need to analyze the facts by organizing and assessing the information you gathered. This process will help you decide and confirm the POE.</p>
<p>You must analyze the answer to each question in order of importance to determine if the employee can be reasonable considered attached to the establishment of the employer.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">

</ul>

<h4 id="h_0_1">Weigh the facts</h4>
<p>This is the most important part of analyzing the information. When reviewing the factors, there may be some facts that support the determination of the POE.</p>
<h4 id="h_0_2">Case-by-case basis</h4>
<p>Whether the POE is considered attached or not needs to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Each case is unique and requires a thorough review of the criteria. There is no one factor that is determinative.</p>
