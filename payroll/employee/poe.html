<p>When you pay employment income such as salaries, wages, or commissions, the employee's province or territory of employment (POE) must be determined so that the proper deductions are withheld. </p>

<p>An <strong>establishment of the employer</strong> is <strong>any place or premises in Canada </strong>that is owned, leased or rented by an employer where employees report to work or from which employees are paid. For purposes of POE, <strong>this does not need to be a permanent establishment</strong>.</p>
 

<details><summary>Income tax legislated by the province or territory</summary>
<p><strong>CRA's mandate </strong>is to <strong>administer </strong>provincial and territorial personal income tax as legislated by the province or territory. Any concerns regarding the tax policy of a province or territory should be directed to the applicable provincial or territorial Ministry of Finance.</p>
