<h2 id="h_1">How GST/HST applies to benefits</h2>
<p>GST/HST does not apply to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Salaries and wages </li>
<li>Commissions </li>
<li>Gratuities </li>
<li>Other cash remuneration you pay to employees </li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the GST/HST applies to an employee benefit or non-cash compensation (also called a fringe or employee taxable benefit) is largely based on whether the employee's benefit is taxable under the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>Generally, if an employee benefit is taxable for income tax purposes, you are also considered to have made a supply of the property or service to your employee. If GST/HST applies to that property or service, you are considered to have collected the GST/HST on the benefit. </p>
<p>However, there are situations where you will not be considered to have collected the GST/HST on a taxable employee benefit.</p>

<h2 id="h_2">Determine if you have to remit GST/HST on benefits</h2>
<p id="gst">You have to remit GST/HST if it is considered to be collected on the taxable benefit.</p>

<h3>Situation: GST/HST not considered collected</h3>
<div id="ajax-not1">
<p>Situations where you are not considered to have collected the GST/HST on a taxable benefit provided to your employee:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The property or service that gives rise to the taxable benefit is GST/HST exempt or zero-rated</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The taxable benefit results from an allowance included in the income of the employee under paragraph 6(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are restricted from claiming an input tax credit (ITC) in the situations described in <a href="#h_4">ITC restrictions</a> for the GST/HST paid or payable on the property and services that give rise to the taxable benefit </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The property or service that gives rise to the taxable benefit is supplied outside Canada </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>You, as an employer who is a GST/HST registrant, would like to reward an employee for outstanding performance, and you have agreed to pay for hotel accommodations and three meals a day, for one week, in London, England. An amount will be included in the income of the employee as a taxable benefit. However, you will not be considered to have collected tax in respect of the benefit provided to the employee, since the supplies were made outside of Canada.</p>
</details>
</div>
<h4>Situation: GST/HST not considered collected, automobile or motor vehicles</h4>
<div id="ajax-not2">
<p>Under the Excise Tax Act, you are <strong> not considered to have collected the GST/HST</strong> if you make an election by filling out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst30.html">Form GST30, Election for Passenger Vehicles or Aircraft to be Deemed to be Used Exclusively in Non-Commercial Activities</a> (or state in writing the information required on the form) and <strong>one</strong> of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>are an individual or a partnership </strong>and the vehicle that you have <strong>bought </strong>is used less than 90% in the commercial activities of the business </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>are not an individual</strong>, <strong>a partnership</strong>, <strong>or a financial institution</strong>, and the vehicle that you <strong>bought </strong>is used 50% or less in the commercial activities of the business </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>are a financial institution </strong>and choose to treat the vehicle you <strong>lease </strong>or have <strong>bought </strong>as being used only in non-commercial activities of the business </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>are not a financial institution </strong>and you <strong>lease </strong>the vehicle which you use 50% or more in non-commercial activities of the business, and you choose to treat it as being used 90% or more in such non-commercial activities </li>
</ul>
<p>You do not have to send the Form GST30 to the CRA. You must keep this form in your records in case you are asked for it.</p>
</div>
<p> <span class="fas fa-ban text-danger fa-lg"> </span> <strong>If all conditions are met, you do not need to do GST/HST calculations.</strong> </p>                       
<p>To determine if you need to remit GST/HST based on your situation, refer to:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/benefit/index.html">Determine if a benefit is taxable</a> </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/payment/index.html">Determine the tax treatment of payments other than regular employment income</a> </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_3">When to remit the GST/HST</h2>
<div id="ajax-remit">
<p>GST/HST calculated on benefits must be remitted as follows:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4 class="text-muted">Employee benefits</h4> <p>In the year after the year you provided the benefit at the <strong>end of February</strong> (this is also the deadline for distributing the slips to your employees)</p></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4 class="text-muted">Shareholder benefits</h4><p>In the year after the year you provided the benefit at the <strong>end of June</strong></p></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4 class="text-muted">Reimbursements made by employees (or their relatives) on benefits</h4><p>In the GST/HST reporting period after the <strong>date of the reimbursement</strong></p></li>

</ul>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>You are a GST/HST registrant and have a monthly reporting period. Although you calculated the taxable benefits, including any GST/HST and PST, for each applicable pay period provided to your employees during 2022, you are considered to have collected the GST/HST on the taxable benefits at the end of February 2023. In your GST/HST return for the reporting period that includes the last day of February 2023, you have to include the GST/HST for the taxable benefits given to your employees in the prior calendar year on line 103 (line 105 if filed electronically) of your GST/HST return.</p>
</details>
</div>

<h2 id="h_4">Can you claim input tax credits (ITCs) on benefits</h2>
<p>As a GST/HST registrant, you can claim an ITC to recover the GST/HST paid or payable on the purchases and operating expenses related to your commercial activities. Generally, commercial activities include the making of supplies of taxable property and services. </p>
<p><strong>For employee benefits</strong>, you can usually claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable on property and services you supply to your employees or their relatives as a benefit if it is related to your commercial activities.</p>
<h3>ITC restrictions</h3>
<p>In some situations, you will not be able to claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable for property or services that give rise to taxable benefits you provide your employees.</p>
<p>Remember, if you cannot claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable for property or services that give rise to a taxable benefit due to the restrictions described in one of the following paragraphs, you are not considered to have collected the GST/HST and, as a result, you do not have to remit the GST/HST on that benefit.</p>
<details><summary> Club memberships</summary>
<p>You may pay or reimburse fees for membership to any club whose main purpose is to provide dining, recreational, or sporting facilities. In such cases, you cannot claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable, regardless of whether the club membership fees or dues are a taxable benefit for the employee for income tax purposes.</p>
<p>However, you can claim ITCs for the GST/HST paid or payable on such memberships if you acquire the memberships exclusively for supply in the ordinary course of a business of supplying them.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Exclusive personal use</summary>
<p>You cannot claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable on property or services you acquire, import, or bring into a participating province for the exclusive personal consumption, use, or enjoyment (90% or more) of an employee or an employee's relative.</p>
<p>However, you can claim an ITC in the following situations:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The consumption, use, or enjoyment of the property or service by the employee or their relative does not give rise to a taxable benefit for income tax purposes and no amounts were payable by the employee for this benefit. The most common type of non-taxable benefit is the paying of moving expenses by an employer. </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">During the same GST/HST reporting period, you make a supply of the property or service to an employee or their relative for consideration that becomes due in that period and that is equal to its fair market value </li>
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Property supplied by way of lease, licence, or similar arrangement</summary>
<p>You cannot claim an ITC for the GST/HST paid or payable on property supplied by way of lease, licence, or similar arrangement that is more than 50% for the personal consumption, use, or enjoyment of one of the following:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are <strong>an individual</strong>, yourself or another individual related to you </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are <strong>a partnership</strong>, an individual who is a partner or another individual who is an employee, officer, or shareholder of, or related to, a partner </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are <strong>a corporation</strong>, an individual who is a shareholder or another individual related to the shareholder </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are <strong>a trust</strong>, an individual who is a beneficiary or another individual related to the beneficiary </li>
</ul>
<p>However, you can claim an ITC if, during the same GST/HST reporting period, you make a taxable supply of the property to that individual for consideration that becomes due in that period and that is equal to its fair market value.</p>

</details>

    
<h2 id="h_5">What to do if you have a business in Quebec</h2>
<p>In Quebec, Revenu Québec administers the GST/HST unless you are a person that is a selected listed financial institution (SLFI) for GST/HST or QST purposes or both. </p>
<p>If you pay your employee remuneration or other income and their province of employment is Quebec, as well as deducting federal income tax, you will have to remit the GST/HST to Revenu Quebec.</p>
