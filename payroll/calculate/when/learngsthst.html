<h2 id="h_1">How GST/HST applies to benefits</h2>
<p>Salaries, wages, commissions, and other cash remuneration (including gratuities) you make to employees are not subject to the GST/HST.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>cost of benefits or non-cash compensation </strong>provided to an employee, commonly referred to as fringe or employee taxable benefits <strong>may be subject to the GST/HST</strong>. For the most part, the GST/HST treatment of these benefits is based on their treatment under the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>Generally, if a benefit is taxable for income tax purposes, the CRA considers you to have made a supply of a property or service to the employee.</p>
<p>If the property or service that gives rise to the taxable benefit is subject to GST/HST, you are considered to have collected the GST/HST on that benefit. However, there are situations where you will not be considered to have collected the GST/HST on taxable benefits given to employees. </p>

<h2 id="h_2">Determine if you have to remit GST/HST on benefits</h2>
<p id="gst">Generally, you have to remit GST/HST on the benefit related to automobile standby charges and operating expenses. </p>

<h3>Situation: GST/HST not considered collected</h3>
<div id="ajax-not1">
<p>You are not considered to have collected the GST/HST on taxable benefits provided to employees in any of the following situations:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The property or services that give rise to a taxable benefit are GST/HST exempt or zero-rated </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">A taxable benefit results from an allowance included in the income of the employee under paragraph 6(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are restricted from claiming an input tax credit (ITC) in the situations described in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/benefits-allowances/remitting-gst-hst-on-employee-benefits/input-tax-credits-itcs.html">ITC restrictions</a> for the GST/HST paid or payable on the property and services that give rise to the taxable benefit </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The property or services that give rise to a taxable benefit are supplied outside Canada </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>You, as an employer who is a GST/HST registrant, would like to reward an employee for outstanding performance, and you have agreed to pay for hotel accommodations and three meals a day, for one week, in London, England. An amount will be included in the income of the employee as a taxable benefit. However, you will not be considered to have collected tax in respect of the benefit provided to the employee, since the supplies were made outside of Canada.</p>
</details>
</div>
<div id="ajax-not2">
<p>Under the Excise Tax Act, you are <strong> not considered to have collected the GST/HST</strong> if you make an election by filling out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst30.html">Form GST30, Election for Passenger Vehicles or Aircraft to be Deemed to be Used Exclusively in Non-Commercial Activities</a> (or state in writing the information required on the form) and <strong>one</strong> of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>are an individual or a partnership </strong>and the vehicle that you have <strong>bought </strong>is used less than 90% in the commercial activities of the business </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>are not an individual</strong>, <strong>a partnership</strong>, <strong>or a financial institution</strong>, and the vehicle that you <strong>bought </strong>is used 50% or less in the commercial activities of the business </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>are a financial institution </strong>and choose to treat the vehicle you <strong>lease </strong>or have <strong>bought </strong>as being used only in non-commercial activities of the business </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>are not a financial institution </strong>and you <strong>lease </strong>the vehicle which you use 50% or more in non-commercial activities of the business, and you choose to treat it as being used 90% or more in such non-commercial activities </li>
</ul>
<p>You do not have to send the Form GST30 to the CRA. You must keep this form in your records in case you are asked for it.</p>
</div>
<p> <span class="fas fa-ban text-danger fa-lg"> </span> <strong>If all conditions are met, you do not need to do GST/HST calculations.</strong> </p>                       


<h2 id="h_3">When to remit the GST/HST</h2>

<p>Amounts on benefits must be remitted in the year after the year you provided the benefit as follows:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><strong>Employee</strong> benefit: at the end of <strong>February</strong> (this is also the deadline for distributing the slips to your employees)</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><strong>Shareholder</strong> benefit: at the end of <strong>June</strong></li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>You are a GST/HST registrant and have a monthly reporting period. Although you calculated the taxable benefits, including any GST/HST and PST, for each applicable pay period provided to your employees during 2022, you are considered to have collected the GST/HST on the taxable benefits at the end of February 2023. In your GST/HST return for the reporting period that includes the last day of February 2023, you have to include the GST/HST for the taxable benefits given to your employees in the prior calendar year on line 103 (line 105 if filed electronically) of your GST/HST return.</p>
</details>
<p>If the GST/HST is for a reimbursement made by an employee or an employee's relative for a taxable benefit other than a standby charge or the operating expense of an automobile, the amount may be due in a different reporting period. </p>

    
<h2 id="h_9">What to do if you have a business in Quebec</h2>
<p>In Quebec, Revenu Québec administers the GST/HST unless you are a person that is a selected listed financial institution (SLFI) for GST/HST or QST purposes or both. </p>
<p>If you pay your employee remuneration or other income and their province of employment is Quebec, as well as deducting federal income tax, you will have to remit the GST/HST to Revenu Quebec.</p>

<h2 id="h_4">What to do if your employee requested an increase income tax deductions</h2>
<p>If your employee filled out a <strong>TD1 form</strong>, you need to increase the payment by the amount on the form in order to calculate the taxable amount of the payment.</p>
