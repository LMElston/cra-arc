<div id="ajax-pointcall">
<p>The CRA considers a point of call any location other than a regular place of employment where your employee goes to perform their duties of employment. </p>
<p>Generally, any travel by the employee between home and a point of call is considered business driving, if at that time and on the way to or from work, it is reasonable. </p>
<p>If the travel is not reasonable, it is considered personal driving and is a taxable benefit.</p>
