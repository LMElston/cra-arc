<h4><span class="fas fa-comments fa-xl"> </span> What if the reasonable rate is lower or higher</h4>
<p>The type of vehicle and the driving conditions are example of factors that you can use to determine if an allowance should be lower or higher to be considered reasonable in your situation. </p>
<p>In these situations, you may ask for an advance income tax ruling that is binding on the CRA vis-à-vis the use of a lower or higher reasonable rate. Learn more: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/tax-professionals/income-tax-rulings-interpretations.html">Income tax rulings and technical interpretations</a>  </p>


<details><summary>Examples </summary>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>You pay an allowance to your employee as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>a flat per-diem rate to offset the employee's fixed expenses for each day the vehicle is required </li>
<li>a reasonable per-kilometre rate for each kilometre driven to offset the operating expenses </li>
</ul>
<p>The flat per-diem rate compensates the employee for some of the same use on which the reasonable per-kilometre allowance is based. That is, the fixed expenses incurred by the employee to operate the vehicle.</p>
<p>The combined amount is considered <strong>one </strong>allowance and is taxable because it is <strong>not </strong>based <strong>only </strong>on the number of kilometres the vehicle is used for employment purposes.</p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>You pay an allowance to your employee as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>a flat-rate per month for travel inside the employment district </li>
<li>a reasonable per-kilometre rate for employment-related travel outside the employment district </li>
</ul>
<p>Since the flat-rate allowance does not cover any of the same use of the vehicle on which the reasonable per-kilometre allowance is based, the allowances are considered separately.</p>
<p>The reasonable per-kilometre allowance paid for travel outside the district is <strong>not taxable</strong>. The amount based on a flat-rate paid for travel inside the district is <strong>taxable</strong>, since it is <strong>not </strong>based only on the number of kilometres for which the vehicle is used in connection with the employment.</p>
</details>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the allowance provided to your employee for motor vehicle expenses <strong>do not </strong>meet all of the conditions above, the benefit is taxable and you must calculate the full amount of the allowances.</p>
<p>For example, if the employee both received an allowance in respect of their use of the motor vehicle and is reimbursed in whole or in part for expenses in respect of that use (except where the reimbursement is in respect of supplementary business insurance or toll or ferry charges and the amount of the allowance was determined without reference to those reimbursed expenses).</p>
<details><summary>Examples </summary>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>You are a controller at a retirement home. Currently, employees receive a rate of $0.35 per kilometre for automobile and motor vehicle allowances when they have to travel for work to help the residents with their daily tasks. This rate was negotiated in the last collective agreement and the collective agreement is signed for four years. You understands that the $0.35 rate is lower than the reasonable per-kilometre rate.</p>
<p>In this example, the allowance is considered a taxable benefit because the rate per kilometre is not considered reasonable because it is lower than the reasonable per-kilometre rate. </p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>You own an office supply company where you employ workers on the road as salespersons. Each salesperson has a specific territory to cover and they use their own vehicle. They are paid a monthly flat rate allowance of $600 no matter where they go or how far they drive. This was agreed on when they were hired and is cited in their respective employment contracts. </p>
<p>In this example, the flat rate allowance is considered a taxable benefit because it is not based on the number of business kilometers driven. Therefore, the allowance must be included in the employees' income.</p>

<details><summary>Situation: The employee owns the motor vehicle - You reimburse your employee for motor vehicle expenses</summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you reimburse your employee to compensate for the operating costs of a motor vehicle they own, the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">It is a reasonable motor vehicle expenses incurred for <a href="#personal" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">business purposes&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> (in connection with or during the course of the office or employment duties)</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee provides you supporting documents or receipts to confirm the amounts reimbursed</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>An employee uses their automobile approximately 5 times per month to do deliveries for their employer. In exchange for this service, the employer provides the employee with a company credit card to pay for gas for their automobile. </p>

<p>Based on gas, insurance and wear and tear, the employee estimates that the cost of using their automobile for work totals $250 per year. The company's credit card statements show that the employee spent $1,500 in gas and insurance in the year. </p>
<p>In this situation, the taxable benefit for the employee is <strong>$1,250 </strong>($1,500 minus their cost of $250). The $250 is work-related travel expenses and is not taxable. </p>
</details>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the reimbursement you provide to your employee for motor vehicle expenses <strong>do not</strong> meet all of the conditions above, it is a taxable benefit.</p>

<p>Continue to <a href="#doc">Step 3 - Get the required records from your employee to accurately calculate the motor vehicle benefit</a>.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Situation: The employee owns the motor vehicle - You provide an accountable advance to your employee for motor vehicle expenses</summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide an accountable advance to compensate for the operating expenses of a motor vehicle they own, the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee accounts with vouchers for their kilometres travelled <a href="#personal" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">business purposes&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> (in connection with or during the course of the office or employment duties) and the amounts they received</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If your employee was under the amount of the advance, the employee was required to return the difference by the final day of employment for the year or December 31st, whichever is earliest</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If your employee is over the advance amount, you toped up the advance by the final day of employment for the year or December 31st, whichever is earliest</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The accountable advance total amount is not more than the total amount for the <a href="#rates" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">reasonable allowance rate per-kilometre &nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You document in your employee’s record the method for establishing and keeping track of the accountable advance</li>

</ul>
<details><summary>Examples</summary>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>You own a sporting goods store. There is an out of town sales conference your business is participating in and you have scheduled one salesperson to attend. Two weeks prior to travel, you pay an accountable advance to your salesperson to cover expenses relating to the use of their personal vehicle to travel to and from the conference. This amount is based on the reasonable per-kilometre rate. The salesperson accounted for their expenses.</p>
<p>In this example, the advance is <strong>not </strong>considered a taxable benefit because: </p>

<ul>
<li>The rate per kilometre is considered reasonable </li>
<li>The employee accounted for their expenses by producing vouchers and returned any amount they did not spend </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>You are a manager for an insurance company. Your employees travel frequently to meet new and existing clients as part of their duties. Given the frequency of travel of representatives, you use the averaging allowances method to calculate the accountable advance your employees receive each pay to cover eligible expenses relating to the use of their personal vehicles. The amounts are based on the reasonable per-kilometre rate, and are recorded in the employees' files. </p>
<p>At the end of the year, the employees provide you with a log book that lists the amount of business kilometres they have travelled and any advances they have received. You review the advances paid to your employees and their eligible expenses, at which time the company will pay any amounts owing to the employee or the employee will reimburse any amounts received that exceed their eligible expenses.       </p>
<p>In this example, the advance is <strong>not </strong>considered a taxable benefit because: </p>

<ul>
<li>there is a pre-established per-kilometre rate that is not more than a reasonable amount </li>
<li>the rate and the advance are reasonable under the circumstances </li>
<li>the method is documented in the employee's file </li>
</ul>
</details>


<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the accountable advance you provide to your employee for motor vehicle expenses <strong>do not</strong> meet all of the conditions above, it is a taxable benefit.</p>

<details><summary> Examples</summary>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>ABC Restaurant Inc. uses a van that has been specially modified so it can be used more efficiently to transport and deliver food orders. The employer has asked the manager, Leslie, to take the van home at night in case she needs to respond to an emergency at the restaurant, such as an after hour alarm or to fill in on busy nights. Leslie is not allowed to use the van for any other personal use. Since she is the manager, her employment duties do not include delivering food orders, even on a busy night.</p>
<p>ABC Restaurant cannot use the lower (33 cents per kilometre) rate when calculating Leslie's taxable benefit. These circumstances do not meet all of the conditions of the administrative policy. Although the vehicle has been modified for business needs, Leslie does not need the van to perform her employment duties, so she does not have to bring it home for valid business reasons.</p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>Mary works for a gas utility company and has to be on-call two weekends out of every month. On these weekends, she has to be able to respond to emergencies directly from her home. The van, which the employer provides Mary for these weekends, displays the company's name, has a light on the roof and has been permanently modified to carry specialized equipment to the scene of the emergencies. The company has a written policy prohibiting any other personal use of these vehicles, other than driving between the worksite and home. Mary has not used the vehicle for any other personal driving.</p>
<p>Since this situation meets all of the conditions of the administrative policy, Mary's employer may calculate the personal use of the vehicle using the reduced rate of 33 cents per kilometre.</p>

<h4>Employee's allowable employment expenses</h4>
<p>Your employee may be able to claim certain employment expenses on their income tax and benefit return if, under the contract of employment, the employee had to pay for their expenses. This contract of employment does not have to be in writing but you and your employee have to agree to the terms and understand what is expected.</p>
<p>In this situation, you need to complete Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2200.html">Form T2200, Declaration of Conditions of Employment</a> and give it to your employee so they can deduct employment expenses from their income. By signing the form, you are only certifying that the employee met the conditions of employment and had to pay for the expenses under their employment contract. </p>
<p>It is the employee's responsibility to claim the expenses on their income tax and benefits return and to keep records to support the claim.</p>
