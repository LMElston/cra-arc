<h3>Situations</h3>

<details><summary>Situation: You provide an <strong>allowance</strong> to your employee </summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the Income Tax Act (ITA) exemption, if you paid an allowance to your employee to compensate for using their own vehicle in connection with or in the course of their office or employment, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable and your employee <strong>does not</strong> have to provide you with supporting documents or receipts, if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The allowance is calculated <strong>only </strong>on the actual number of kilometres for <a href="#personal2" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">business purposes&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> (in connection with or during the course of the office or employment duties)</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The <a href="#rates" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">rate per-kilometre is reasonable&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>, meaning:
<ul>
<li>The rate matches the reasonable allowance rate per-kilometre</li>
<li>If the rate does not match the reasonable allowance rate per-kilometre, <strong>you must be able to justify your position</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You <strong>do not</strong> reimburse the employee for the expenses related to the same use of the vehicle, unless the reimbursement is for supplementary business insurance, or tolls and ferry charges not covered by the allowance </li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Reasonable allowance rates for the use of motor vehicles (per kilometre)</summary>

 <div data-ajax-replace="ajax/reasonable-rate-vehicle.txt"></div>
</details>

<h4><span class="fas fa-comments fa-xl"> </span> What if the reasonable rates are different from the prescribed rate</h4>
<p>The type of vehicle and the driving conditions are example of factors that you can use to determine if an allowance should be lower or higher to be considered reasonable in your situation. </p>
<p>In these situations, you may ask for an advance income tax ruling that is binding on the CRA vis-à-vis the use of a lower or higher reasonable rate. Learn more: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/tax-professionals/income-tax-rulings-interpretations.html">Income tax rulings and technical interpretations</a>  </p>


<details><summary>Examples </summary>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>You pay an allowance to your employee as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>A flat per-diem rate to offset the employee's fixed expenses for each day the vehicle is required </li>
<li>A reasonable per-kilometre rate for each kilometre driven to offset the operating expenses </li>
</ul>
<p>The flat per-diem rate compensates the employee for some of the same use on which the reasonable per-kilometre allowance is based. That is, the fixed expenses incurred by the employee to operate the vehicle.</p>
<p>The combined amount is considered <strong>one </strong>allowance and is taxable because it is <strong>not </strong>based <strong>only </strong>on the number of kilometres the vehicle is used for employment purposes.</p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>You pay an allowance to your employee as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>A flat-rate per month for travel inside the employment district </li>
<li>A reasonable per-kilometre rate for employment-related travel outside the employment district </li>
</ul>
<p>Since the flat-rate allowance does not cover any of the same use of the vehicle on which the reasonable per-kilometre allowance is based, the allowances are considered separately.</p>
<p>The reasonable per-kilometre allowance paid for travel outside the district is <strong>not taxable</strong>. The amount based on a flat-rate paid for travel inside the district is <strong>taxable</strong>, since it is <strong>not </strong>based only on the number of kilometres for which the vehicle is used in connection with the employment.</p>
</details>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the allowance provided to your employee for motor vehicle expenses <strong>does not </strong>meet all of the conditions above, the benefit is taxable.</p>
<p>Automobile and motor vehicles allowances which are taxable and must be included in the employee's income include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allowances paid at per-kilometre rates that are not considered reasonable because they are either too high or too low </li>
<li>Flat-rate allowances paid to employees where the amount paid is not related to the number of kilometres driven </li>
<li>Allowances that combine flat-rate and reasonable per-kilometre allowances for the same use of the vehicle </li>
<li>Allowances received where the employee is also reimbursed for the same use of the vehicle (except where the reimbursement is in respect of supplementary business insurance or toll or ferry charges and the amount of the allowance was determined without reference to those reimbursed expenses) </li>
</ul>


<details><summary>Examples </summary>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>You are a controller at a retirement home. Currently, employees receive a rate of $0.35 per kilometre for automobile and motor vehicle allowances when they have to travel for work to help the residents with their daily tasks. This rate was negotiated in the last collective agreement and the collective agreement is signed for four years. You understand that the $0.35 rate is lower than the reasonable per-kilometre rate.</p>
<p>In this example, the allowance is considered a taxable benefit because the rate per kilometre is not considered reasonable because it is lower than the reasonable per-kilometre rate. Therefore, the allowance must to be included in the employees' income, and CPP, EI, and income tax must be deducted from the allowance.</p>
<p>It is important to note that collective agreements do not supersede the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>If the allowance does not cover all of the employee’s out-of-pocket expenses, they would be eligible to claim their auto and motor vehicle expenses on their income tax return. To do so, you as the employer will need to complete Form T2200, Declaration of Conditions of Employment. For more information, see Employees' allowable employment expenses.</p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>You own an office supply company where you employ workers on the road as salespersons. Each salesperson has a specific territory to cover and they use their own vehicle. They are paid a monthly flat rate allowance of $600 no matter where they go or how far they drive. This was agreed on when they were hired and is cited in their respective employment contracts. </p>
<p>In this example, the flat rate allowance is considered a taxable benefit because it is not based on the number of business kilometres driven. Therefore, the allowance must be included in the employees' income.</p>

<details><summary>Situation: You <strong>reimburse</strong> your employee</summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you reimburse your employee to compensate for using their own vehicle in connection with or in the course of their office or employment, the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">It is a reasonable reimbursement of automobile or motor vehicle expenses incurred for <a href="#personal" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">business purposes&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> (in connection with or during the course of the office or employment duties)</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee provides you supporting documents or receipts to confirm the amounts reimbursed</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>An employee uses their automobile approximately 5 times per month to do deliveries for their employer. In exchange for this service, the employer provides the employee with a company credit card to pay for gas for their automobile. </p>

<p>Based on gas, insurance and wear and tear, the employee estimates that the cost of using their automobile for work totals $250 per year. The company's credit card statements show that the employee spent $1,500 in gas and insurance in the year. </p>
<p>In this situation, the taxable benefit for the employee is <strong>$1,250 </strong>($1,500 minus their cost of $250). The $250 is work-related travel expenses and is not taxable. </p>
</details>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the reimbursement you provide to your employee for automobile or motor vehicle expenses <strong>does not</strong> meet all of the conditions above, it is a taxable benefit.</p>

</details>

<details><summary>Situation: You provide an <strong>accountable advance</strong> to your employee </summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide an accountable advance to your employee to compensate for using their own vehicle in connection with or in the course of their office or employment, the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee provides you with vouchers to account for their kilometres travelled for  <a href="#personal" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">business purposes&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> (in connection with or during the course of the office or employment duties) </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">There is a pre-established per-kilometre rate that is not more than a reasonable amount</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The rate and the advances are reasonable under the circumstances</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You document in your employee’s record the method for establishing and keeping track of the accountable advance</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">No other provision of the Income Tax Act requires you to include the advances in the employee’s income</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If your employee’s expenses were under the amount of the advance, the employee was required to return the difference by the final day of employment for the year or December 31st, whichever is earliest</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If your employee’s expenses were over the advance amount, you topped up the advance by the final day of employment for the year or December 31st, whichever is earliest</li>
</ul>

<p>You are not allowed to take a flat-rate or lump-sum allowance not based on the amount of kilometres driven and average it at the end of the year to determine a reasonable per-kilometre rate and then be excluded from the employee’s income.</p>

<details><summary>Examples</summary>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>You own a sporting goods store. There is an out of town sales conference your business is participating in and you have scheduled one salesperson to attend. Two weeks prior to travel, you pay an accountable advance to your salesperson to cover expenses relating to the use of their personal vehicle to travel to and from the conference. This amount is based on the reasonable per-kilometre rate. The salesperson accounted for their expenses.</p>
<p>In this example, the advance is <strong>not </strong>considered a taxable benefit because: </p>

<ul>
<li>The rate per kilometre is considered reasonable </li>
<li>The employee accounted for their expenses by producing vouchers and returned any amount they did not spend </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>You are a manager for an insurance company. Your employees travel frequently to meet new and existing clients as part of their duties. Given the frequency of travel of representatives, you use the averaging allowances method to calculate the accountable advance your employees receive each pay to cover eligible expenses relating to the use of their personal vehicles. The amounts are based on the reasonable per-kilometre rate, and are recorded in the employees' files. </p>
<p>At the end of the year, the employees provide you with a log book that lists the amount of business kilometres they have travelled and any advances they have received. You review the advances paid to your employees and their eligible expenses, at which time the company will pay any amounts owing to the employee or the employee will reimburse any amounts received that exceed their eligible expenses.       </p>
<p>In this example, the advance is <strong>not </strong>considered a taxable benefit because: </p>

<ul>
<li>There is a pre-established per-kilometre rate that is not more than a reasonable amount </li>
<li>The rate and the advance are reasonable under the circumstances </li>
<li>The method is documented in the employee's file </li>
</ul>
</details>


<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the accountable advance you provide to your employee for motor vehicle expenses <strong>does not</strong> meet all of the conditions above, it is a taxable benefit.</p>
