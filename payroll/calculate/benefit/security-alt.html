<p>You need to determine if there is an agreement between a qualifying person (corporation or a mutual trust fund) and the employee. </p>
<p>There may be a written stock option agreement, or if there is no written agreement, the terms for issuing securities, stock and trust units in the financial records of a corporation (for example, a directors' resolution in the corporate minutes or notes to financial statements) will determine the employment status of the person receiving the benefit. </p>

<details><summary>Agreement between a qualifying person and the <strong>person ceased to be an employee</strong> [7(4)]</summary>
<h4 id="step1b">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person and the person ceased to be an employee, the benefit is considered received by virtue of employment. </p>
<details><summary>Explanation</summary>
<p>If a person was an employee at the time of receiving a right to acquire shares, but subsequently ceases to be an employee (for example, change jobs or retire) before the exercise or transfer of that right he is treated as an employee until the transaction is completed. The benefit is included in his employment income and he is deemed to have received the benefit as if he were still employed.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<ul>
<li>A person had the option to purchase 10,000 shares of ABC Inc. when the employment began </li>
<li>On November 30, 2020, the person employment ceased when they resigned from his position as Manager </li>
<li>A clause in the stock option agreement allowed the person to purchase these shares within a period of 90 calendar days after the date of termination </li>
<li>On January 20, 2021, the person chose to purchase 20,000 shares at the price of $.50 cents per share </li>
</ul>
<p>Although the person's employment ceased on November 30, 2020, any benefit from the purchase of shares in ABC Inc. on January 20, 2021 is considered taxable under subsection 7(1) </p>

<h4 id="step1c">Not by virtue of employment</h4>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">Benefit is a distribution of profits </li>

<p>Under 7(5), section 7 does not apply if "the benefit conferred by the agreement was not received in respect of, in the course of, or by virtue of, the employment".</p>
<p>If the employee is also a shareholder, it is a question of fact whether the individual received the shares in their capacity as a shareholder <strong>or </strong>an employee. Section 7 does not apply when the benefit conferred by the stock option agreement was not received by reason of the <strong>individual's employment</strong>.</p>
<p>If an individuals' or a group of individuals' shareholding are sufficiently large so as to enable them to be in a position to control the company's actions, it is questionable whether the benefit was received "<strong>by virtue of employment</strong>".</p>
<p>You need to determine if the benefit resulted from the individual's role as an employee or their role as a shareholder. In addition to control, other factors must be considered.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<ul>
<li>Person is president of ABC Inc. </li>
<li>Owns 51% of that corporation's common voting shares </li>
<li>Spouse owns 10% </li>
<li>Person and his spouse are the only people with a stock option agreement from ABC Inc. </li>
<li>The plan was not offered to any other employee. </li>
</ul>
<p>The person is in a position of control. The person and the spouse receive the benefit because of his capacity as a shareholder. Section 7 of the ITA does not apply because the benefit was not received "in respect of", "in the course of", or "by virtue of", employment. </p>
</details>
<h4 id="step1c2">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person who is not a shareholder or does not meet all of the above conditions, the benefit is considered received by virtue of employment.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Agreement between a qualifying person and a <strong>self-employed</strong> person [7(5)]</summary>
<h4 id="step1d">Not by virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person and a self-employed person, this is <strong> not</strong> considered received by virtue of employment. </p>

<details><summary>Explanation</summary>
<p>This is not taxable as an employee benefit because it is a self-employed person and it is <strong>not </strong>considered received by virtue of employment. Under 7(5), the section 7 does not apply if "the benefit conferred by the agreement was not received in respect of, in the course of, or by virtue of, the employment".</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>A person is a self-employed consultant. The person is contracted on a short-term basis by a junior public mining corporation to raise capital. Part of the contract, the person was offered participation in the corporation's stock option benefit plan with details outlined in a stock option agreement.  </p>
<p>The person was not an employee of the junior public mining corporation. Section 7 does not apply because the benefit was not received "in respect of", "in the course of", or "by virtue of", employment.</p>
</details>
</details>

<details><summary>Agreement between a qualifying person and a <strong>non-resident employer</strong></summary>
<h4 id="step1e">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person and a non-resident employer, the benefit is considered received by virtue of employment. </p>
<details><summary>Explanation</summary>
<p>The wording of section 7 of the ITA is broad enough to encompass where a non-resident corporation (whether public or private) agrees to sell or issue shares (either of itself or of another corporation with which it does not deal at arm's length) to individuals either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employed by it in Canada </li>
<li>Employed in Canada by a corporation with which the non-resident corporation does not deal at arm's length </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, where the foreign parent of a Canadian subsidiary agrees to sell or issue shares of the parent corporation to employees of the subsidiary.</p>
<p>Care must be taken in reviewing these cases to ensure that the foreign plan conforms to Canadian tax rules in order to determine if sections 7 and 110(1)(d) apply. (For example, the shares concerned may not meet the requirements under regulation 6204(1) to be considered prescribed shares. Consequently, the employee would not be eligible for the security options deduction under 110(1)(d).)</p>
<p>When calculating the taxable benefit, the foreign stock options must be converted to the Canadian dollar equivalent. Use the exchange rate (available from the company or the Bank of Canada) in effect on the dates that make up the transaction (acquisition date): the date the shares are paid for and the date when the treasury shares have been transferred to the employee. Where the amount paid or to be paid by an employee pursuant to the terms of a stock option agreement is expressed in terms of a foreign currency, it will not compromise the employee's eligibility for the deduction under paragraph 110(1)(d).</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<ul>
<li>On March 7, an employee is granted 100 options to purchase shares of their employer's parent corporation at the FMV of $10 US ($1 US = $1.35 CDN). </li>
<li>On September 2 the employee informs their employer that they wish to exercise their 100 options and pays the employer $1000 US ($1 US = $1.25 CDN). The exercise price is $10 US and the FMV is $20 US on this date. </li>
<li>On September 5 the treasury shares are transferred to the employee at a FMV of $19 US ($1 US = $1.20 CDN). </li>
</ul>
</details>
</details>

<details><summary>Agreement between a qualifying person and a <strong>trustee</strong> (as an intermediary)</summary>
<h4 id="step1f">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person and a trustee (as an intermediary), the benefit is considered received by virtue of employment.</p>
<details><summary>Explanation</summary>
<p>When the employer uses a trust as an intermediary to sell or issue its shares held in a corporation with which it does not deal at arm's length, the employee is still considered to be dealing with the employer per section 7(2) of the ITA. Where the trustee holds the securities for an employee, acquisitions and dispositions of the securities by the trustee are treated as acquisitions and dispositions by the employee for the purposes of section 7 and paragraphs 110(1)(d), 110(1)(d.1) and (d.01) of the Act.</p>
<p>Where the employee exercises a security option and the agreement provides for the shares to be held in trust, but the employee does not meet the conditions of the agreement and the shares are forfeited back to the issuing corporation, there is no change to the taxable benefit reported on the T4. However, the employee may become eligible for a deduction under subsection 8(12) of the Income Tax Act. When the individual is eligible, this deduction may be claimed when filing the T1, and is equal to the value of the stock option benefit previously received (less 50% if the individual has previously claimed the stock option deduction for the benefit).</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>Ashley is granted 10,000 options on March 4, 2014, when the FMV of each share is $20. Ashley must be an employee for at least three years after date of exercise before the shares are fully vested, or the employer may buy back the shares for $0.01 each. Ashley exercises her option on May 1, 2015, when the FMV of each share is $25. In 2015, Ashley's benefit is equal to $50,000 [10,000 x (25-20)], and this amount is reported on her T4.</p>
<p>On June 1, 2016, Ashley leaves the company, and as a result, forfeits her securities, and receives $100 in consideration for the $50,000 of shares. There are no changes to Ashley's T4 for 2014, 2015, or 2016, but when Ashley files her tax return, she may, in the year in which she forfeited the securities, claim a deduction of $50,000 from her income.</p>
