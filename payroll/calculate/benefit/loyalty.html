<p class="mrgn-bttm-lg"><p>Your employees may collect loyalty or other points, such as frequent flyer points or air miles, on credit cards when travelling on employer-reimbursed business trips or incurring other business-related expenses.</p>
<p>Generally, when your employee <strong>redeems </strong>loyalty or other points collected by you as their employer, it is a taxable benefit. The benefit only arises when the <strong>points are redeemed by the employee.</strong></p>
<p>Depending on how the plan itself is structured, the benefit may not be taxable under the <a href="#adminpolicy" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">CRA's administrative policy&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> when your employee collects the points from a loyalty or other points program.  </p>

	<p> The CRA's administrative policy does not apply if you (employer) collect the points derived from a loyalty or other points program. The benefit received by the employee from redeeming the points is taxable. </p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The points are not controlled by you </li>

<details><summary>Example 1 - No calculation</summary>
<p>An employee uses their personal credit card to pay for employment-related purchases. The employer reimburses the employee. The card offers loyalty points which the employee converts to cash for a total amount received of $300.</p>
<p>The amount received as cash is <strong>not </strong>a taxable benefit as the points were not accumulated on a card where the employer collected the points. The cash amount received must be reported on the employee's T1 return as the points were converted to cash. </p>

The points are predominately collected from personal purchases. Employee redeems the non-cash loyalty points for the base fare ($600) on their personal airline booking.</p>
<p>The benefit received is <strong>not </strong>a taxable benefit as the employer does not control the points, the points were not converted to cash and the arrangement was not indicative of an alternative form or remuneration or tax avoidance. </p>

The employee also collects points on their personal purchases. The employer does not receive a statement or any information regarding the employees points earned on the employee's frequent flyer card. The points are predominately collected from personal purchases. The employee uses the points to purchase a sound bar with a FMV of $400.</p>
