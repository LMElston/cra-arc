<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>Content has been developed to provide guidance only and it does not replace the law. <strong>No changes were made to the existing legislative requirement. </strong></p>
</div>
<p>It is important to decide whether a worker is an <strong>employee </strong>or a <strong>self-employed individual</strong>. Employment status directly affects a person's entitlement to employment insurance (EI) benefits under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-5.6/index.html">Employment Insurance Act</a>. It can also have an impact on how a worker is treated under other legislation such as the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-8/index.html">Canada Pension Plan</a> and the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/index.html">Income Tax Act</a>.</p>
<p>The facts of the working relationship as a whole decide the employment status.</p>


<ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd">

<li><h3>Contract arrangement </h3>
<p class="brdr-bttm">The CRA asks the worker and the payer what their intent was when they entered into the working arrangement. Workers and payers can choose how they set up their affairs. However, the employment status they choose must reflect their working relationship.</p>

<p class="brdr-bttm">A personal services business is a business that a corporation carries on to provide services to another entity (such as a person or partnership) that an officer or employee of that entity would usually perform.

<details><summary>What is considered a personal services business (PSB)</summary>
<div id="ajax-psb">
<p>The worker is considered a personal services business (PSB) if <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The incorporated employee who is performing the services, or any person related to the incorporated employee, is a <strong>specified shareholder </strong>of the corporation (a specified shareholder is an individual who <strong>directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the issued shares </strong>of any class of a capital stock of the corporation or a related corporation) </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The incorporated employee, if it were not for the existence of the corporation, would reasonably be considered an officer or employee of the entity receiving the services </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The corporation does not employ <strong>more </strong>than five full-time employees throughout the year </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The corporation's income is from services performed by the worker, as the incorporated employee, on behalf of the corporation </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example of a personal services business</summary>
<p>John Smith is offered a 20 month IT contract with ABC Corp. However, ABC Corp. requires John to offer his services through a corporation. John sets up a corporation for which he will be the sole employee and shareholder of that corporation. ABC Corp. then pays the newly set up corporation as John performs services for them. It will be John's responsibility to pay himself through his own corporation as he is an incorporated employee.</p>
<p>By comparison, Cliff Jones operates his own sole proprietorship and provides IT consulting and support to numerous clients. He controls his hours of work providing that the client's needs are met, provides the equipment and supplies, hires employees to help him do the work. If Cliff incorporates, and continues to have multiple clients and possibly employees, he is considered to be operating a business as a corporation.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to John's situation, where John only provides IT services to ABC Corp. His services would normally be provided by an employee of ABC Corp. Therefore, John's corporation is a personal services business.</p></details>

<h3> Tips </h3>
<p>Control is the ability, authority, or right of a hirer to exercise control over a worker concerning the manner in which the work is done and what work will be done. Combined with other factors, if the control factors suggests that the worker has a high degree of control, it may be an indication that the worker is an independent contractor. </p> 
<p>Specific to PSB: The degree of control exercised by the payer over the service provider’s duties (more control may indicate an employment relationship)</p>
<p>Specific to PSB: Providing similar services to other clients also indicates self-employment </p>

</li>

<li><h3> Ownership of the tools and equipment </h3>
<p class="brdr-bttm">Consider if the worker owns and provides tools and equipment to accomplish the work. Contractual control of, and responsibility for, an asset in a rental or lease situation is also considered under this factor.  </p> 

<p>Who owns the most important tools that the worker uses while performing services for the hirer?</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker </li>
<li>Hirer </li>
<li>Both </li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><h3> Subcontracting work or hiring assistants </h3>
<p class="brdr-bttm">Consider if the worker can subcontract work or hire assistants. This factor can help decide a worker's business presence because subcontracting work or hiring assistants can affect their chance of profit and risk of loss.</p>

  </div>
</div></div></form></div></div>
</li>


<li><h3>Financial risk</h3>
<p class="brdr-bttm">Consider the degree of financial risk taken by the worker. Consider if there are any fixed ongoing costs incurred by the worker or any expenses that are not reimbursed. </p> 

<p>Other than the loss of work, is the worker personally at risk of loss? (e.g., liability, additional cost of re-doing work that fails to meet client satisfaction, etc.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes </li>
<li>No </li>
</ul>
<p>Is the worker reimbursed for work-related travel expenses?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes </li>
<li>No </li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><h3> Responsibility for investment and management</h3>
<p class="brdr-bttm">Consider the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker. A significant investment is evidence that a business relationship may exist. You should also consider if the worker is free to make business decisions that affect their profit or loss. </p> 

</li>

<li><h3> Opportunity for profit</h3>
<p class="brdr-bttm">Consider whether the worker can realize a profit or incur a loss, as this indicates that a worker controls the business aspects of services rendered and that a business relationship likely exists. To have a chance of a profit and a risk of a loss, a worker has to have potential proceeds and expenses, and one could exceed the other. </p>
