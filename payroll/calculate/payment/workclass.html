 <h2 id="h_0">Why do you need to determine the employment status</h2>
<p>It is important to decide whether a worker is an <strong>employee </strong>or a <strong>self-employed individual</strong>. Employment status directly affects a person's entitlement to employment insurance (EI) benefits under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-5.6/index.html">Employment Insurance Act</a>. It can also have an impact on how a worker is treated under other legislation such as the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-8/index.html">Canada Pension Plan</a> and the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/index.html">Income Tax Act</a>.</p>
<p>The facts of the working relationship as a whole decide the employment status.</p>
<details><summary>What is considered an employee or a self-employed (independent contractor)</summary>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12">
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Employee</dt> <dd> A person who works in the service of another person (the employer) under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance. </dd>
<dt>Self-employed worker (independent contractor)</dt><dd> One who is hired to undertake a specific project but who is left free to do the assigned work and to choose the method for accomplishing it. Unlike an employee, an independent contractor who commits a wrong while carrying out the work does not create liability for the one who did the hiring.</dd>

 <h2 id="h_00">Who can use the guidance to determine employment status </h2>

<details><summary>Employers</summary>
<p>If you are an employer, use this guidance if:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm ">
  
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are directly hiring, or have directly hired, a worker </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are in receipt of a worker's services who operates through their own intermediary </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">There has been a change to an existing contract or service agreement </li>
</ul>
</details>
<details><summary>Payers of other amounts</summary>
<p>If you are payer of other amounts, use this guidance if you want to:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm ">
  
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Check the accuracy of a determination you have been given </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Use the determination as part of a status disagreement process </li>
</ul>
</details>
<details><summary>Workers</summary>
<p>If you are a worker, use this guidance if:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm ">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You want to check the accuracy of a determination you have been given </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You want to use the determination as part of a status disagreement process </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You are providing your services through an intermediary to a small-sized non-public sector client and need to make a determination as part of your responsibilities </li>
</ul>
<p>You may also want to use the guidance if any of this criteria applies and there has been a change to an existing contract or service agreement.</p>
</details>

 <h2 id="h_01">Before you start</h2>
<p>Before you start, you need to know:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and ">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Details of the contract </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The worker's responsibilities </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Who decides what work needs to be done </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Who decides when, where and how the work is done </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">How the worker will be paid </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">If the engagement includes any corporate benefits or reimbursement for expenses </li>
</ul>

 <h2 id="h_1">Factors to consider</h2>
<p>You need to consider multiple factors to determine if the worker is an employee or self-employed. </p>

<ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd">

<li> <h3 id="0"> Determine if the type of employment is considered a special situation </h3>
<p>Before you use this guidance, you need to determine if the type of employment is considered a special situation, this includes:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Barbers and hairdressers </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Caregivers, baby-sitters and domestic workers </li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><span class="fas fa-arrow-down text-success fa-lg"></span> If no special situation apply, continue to <a href="#1">Step 2 - Contract arrangement</a>.</li>
</ul></div>

</li>        
<li> <h3 id="1"> Contract arrangement </h3>
<p>The CRA asks the worker and the payer what their intent was when they entered into the working arrangement. Workers and payers can choose how they set up their affairs. However, the employment status they choose must reflect their working relationship.</p>
<details><summary>What is considered a valid contract </summary>
<h4 id="h_0_1">Validity of the contract</h4>
<p>Contracts can be formed either orally or in writing. An oral contract is as valid and enforceable as a written contract.</p>
<h4 id="h_0_2">Definition of the essential details of a contract </h4>

<table class="table table-bordered ">

<caption>

<thead>

<tr>
	<th scope="col">
There must be compensation or a reward for a party to carry out its obligations under the contract. </th>

<h4 id="h_0_3">Who decides when a contract is null and void</h4>
<p>When addressing the issue of statutory illegality, the courts can decide that a contract is null and void from the beginning (void ab initio) if the formation of the contract was prohibited by statute and if, in the court's assessment, it would not be contrary to public policy to declare the contract void ab initio.</p>

<p>The conditions that can terminate a contract are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The death of one of the parties. </li>
<li>The expiry of the time stipulated for the duration of the contract by one of the following:
<ul>
<li>the parties </li>
<li>law, in the absence of any by the parties </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Confusion" arising as a result of both parties to the contract becoming one in the same (for example: an individual buys a business (sole proprietorship) that they have an existing contract with and becomes both parties to the same contract) </li>
<li>Misrepresentation </li>
<li>Fraud </li>
<li>Duress </li>
<li>The effect of a resolutory clause in the contract. This would be a clause in the contract that serves to release the parties to the contract from an obligation in the event of a stipulated occurrence or series of events.  </li>
<li>The disrespect of the main clauses of the contract, or significant breach of the conditions outlined in the contract. </li>
<li>A judgment from a competent court. </li>
<li>When the performance required by the contract becomes impossible for one or more of the parties to the contract to honour. Reasons such as a change in law making it illegal for one of the parties to meet their obligations, or the physical incapacity (injury or mental illness) of one or more of the parties can cause a contract to become impossible to honour. </li>
<li>When both the obligations and the consideration set out in the contract have been satisfied. In other words, once a contract is completed, it is at its cessation. </li>
</ul>

<p>Control is the ability, authority, or right of a payer to exercise control over a worker concerning the manner in which the work is done and what work will be done.</p>
<details><summary>Degree of control or independence</summary>
<p>Consider the degree of control held by the payer or the degree of independence held by the worker.</p>
<p>The actual degree of control will vary with the type of work and the skills of the worker.</p>
<p>Deciding the degree of control can be difficult when examining the employment of professionals such as engineers, doctors, and IT consultants. Because of their expertise and specialized training, they may need little or no specific direction in their daily activities. When examining the factor of control, it is necessary to focus on both the payer's control over the worker's daily activities and the payer's influence over the worker.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Payer's right to exercise control</summary>
<p>It is the right of the payer to exercise control that is relevant, <strong>not </strong>whether the payer actually exercises this right.</p>
<p>It is the control of a payer over a worker that is relevant and <strong>not </strong>the control of a payer over the end result of a product or service purchased.</p>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4 id="2_1" class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Indicators that the worker is an employee</h4>
<ul>
<li>The relationship is one of subordination. The payer will often direct, scrutinize, and effectively control many elements of how and when the work is carried out </li>
<li>The payer controls the worker with respect to both the results of the work and the method used to do the work </li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><h3 id="3"> Ownership of the tools and equipment</h3>
<p>Consider if the worker owns and provides tools and equipment to accomplish the work. Contractual control of, and responsibility for, an asset in a rental or lease situation is also considered under this factor.</p>	
<details><summary>What is considered a significant investment</summary>
<p>What is relevant is the significant investment in the tools and equipment along with the cost of replacement, repair, and insurance. A worker who has made a significant investment is likely to retain a right over the use of these assets, diminishing the payer's control over how the work is carried out. In addition, such a significant investment may place the worker at a risk of a financial loss.</p>
<p>Tools and equipment can vary widely in terms of value and can include everything from wrenches and hammers, to specialized clothing, appliances, stethoscopes, musical instruments, computers, and vehicles such as trucks and tractors.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals often supply the tools and equipment required for a contract. As a result, the ownership of tools and equipment by a worker is more commonly associated with a business relationship.</p>
<p>However, employees sometimes also have to provide their own tools. The courts have acknowledged that because a worker is required to provide tools of the trade, this does not in itself mean that the worker is a self-employed individual. For example, many skilled tradespeople such as auto mechanics have to supply their own tools, even if they are full-time employees.</p>

</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><h3 id="5">Financial risk</h3>
<p>Consider the degree of financial risk taken by the worker. Consider if there are any fixed ongoing costs incurred by the worker or any expenses that are not reimbursed.</p>
<details><summary>Employees will usually not have financial risks</summary>
<p>Usually, employees will not have any financial risk as any expenses will be reimbursed, and they will not have fixed ongoing costs.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals, on the other hand, can have financial risk and incur losses because they usually pay fixed monthly costs even if work is not currently being done.</p>
<p>Employees and self-employed individuals may be reimbursed for business or travel expenses. Therefore, focus on the expenses that are <strong>not </strong>reimbursed by the payer.</p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions the CRA may ask you to determine the status</summary>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3 id="7">Opportunity for profit</h3>
<p>Consider whether the worker can realize a profit or incur a loss, as this indicates that a worker controls the business aspects of services rendered and that a business relationship likely exists. To have a chance of a profit and a risk of a loss, a worker has to have potential proceeds and expenses, and one could exceed the other.</p>
<details><summary>Consider this factor from the worker's perspective</summary>
<p>This factor has to be considered from the worker's perspective, not the payer's. It is for the most part an assessment of the degree to which the worker can control their proceeds and expenses.</p>
<p>Employees normally do not have the chance of a profit and risk of a loss even though their remuneration can vary depending on the terms of their employment contracts. For example, employees working on a commission or piece-rate basis, or employees with a productivity bonus clause in their contract can increase their earnings based on their productivity. This increase in income is not normally viewed as a profit, as it is not the excess of proceeds over expenses.</p>
<p>Employees may have expenses directly related to their employment, such as automobile expenses, and board and lodging costs. Normally, expenses would not place employees at risk of incurring a loss because it is unlikely that the expenses would be greater than their remuneration.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals normally have the chance of profit or risk of loss, because they have the ability to pursue and accept contracts as they see fit. They can negotiate the price (or unilaterally set their prices) for their services and have the right to offer those services to more than one payer. Self-employed individuals will normally incur expenses to carry out the terms and conditions of their contracts, and to manage those expenses to maximize net earnings. Self-employed individuals can increase their proceeds and/or decrease their expenses in an effort to increase profit.</p>
<p>Employees generally do not share in profits or suffer losses incurred by the payer's business.</p>
<p>The method of payment may help to decide if the worker has the opportunity to make a profit or incur a loss. In an employer-employee relationship, the worker is normally guaranteed a return for the work done and is usually paid on an hourly, daily, weekly, or similar basis.</p>
<p>Similarly, some self-employed individuals are paid on an hourly basis. However, when a worker is paid a flat rate for the work done, it generally indicates a business relationship, especially if the worker incurs expenses in doing the work.</p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions the CRA may ask you to determine the status</summary>

<li>Is the work relationship continuous in nature, which is, is the work guaranteed? </li>
<li>Is the worker's compensation guaranteed as long as he or she works? </li>
