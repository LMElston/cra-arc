<p>Content has been developed to provide guidance only. The guidance does not replace the law and does not replace a formal request for a ruling. <strong>No changes were made to the existing legislative requirement. </strong></p>
</div>

<p>You need to consider multiple factors to determine if the worker is a personal services business (PSB). </p>
<p>A PSB is a business that a corporation carries on to provide services to another entity (such as a person or partnership) that an officer or employee of that entity would usually perform. Instead, an individual performs the services on behalf of their own corporation. That individual is called an incorporated employee.</p>

<details><summary>Conditions to be considered a PSB</summary>
<div id="ajax-psb">
<p>The worker is considered a PSB if <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The incorporated employee who is performing the services, or any person related to the incorporated employee, is a <strong>specified shareholder </strong>of the corporation (a specified shareholder is an individual who <strong>directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the issued shares </strong>of any class of a capital stock of the corporation or a related corporation) </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The incorporated employee, if it were not for the existence of the corporation, would reasonably be considered an officer or employee of the entity receiving the services </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The corporation does not employ <strong>more </strong>than five full-time employees throughout the year </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The corporation's income is from services performed by the worker, as the incorporated employee, on behalf of the corporation </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example of a PSB</summary>
<p>John Smith is offered a 20 month IT contract with ABC Corp. However, ABC Corp. requires John to offer his services through a corporation. John sets up a corporation for which he will be the sole employee and shareholder of that corporation. ABC Corp. then pays the newly set up corporation as John performs services for them. It will be John's responsibility to pay himself through his own corporation as he is an incorporated employee.</p>
<p>By comparison, Cliff Jones operates his own sole proprietorship and provides IT consulting and support to numerous clients. He controls his hours of work providing that the client's needs are met, provides the equipment and supplies, hires employees to help him do the work. If Cliff incorporates, and continues to have multiple clients and possibly employees, he is considered to be operating a business as a corporation.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to John's situation, where John only provides IT services to ABC Corp. His services would normally be provided by an employee of ABC Corp. Therefore, John's corporation is a PSB.</p></details>

<p>An <strong>employee-employer relationship </strong>between the incorporated employee and the person that received the services must be shown. Both are therefore bound by a contract of employment instead of a contract of enterprise. </p>
