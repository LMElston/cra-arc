<h2 id="h_1">Understanding your responsibilities</h2>		
<details><summary>Employee-employer</summary>
<p>Generally, the employer will deduct <strong>all</strong> of the following from the employee's pay:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and  cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employment insurance (EI) premiums  </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Income tax</li>
</ul>

<p>The employer is responsible to remit (pay) the income taxes, the employee's share and their share of the CPP contributions and the EI premiums they deducted from the employee's pay. By the last day of February, the employer must provide their employees with your T4 slip &ndash; Statement of Remuneration Paid.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Self-employed individual</summary>
<p>Self-employed individuals (independent contractors), do not have CPP, EI, and income tax deducted from amounts paid to them.</p> 

<p>The self-employed individual is responsible to pay <strong>all</strong> of the following at the end of the year:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and  cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employment insurance (EI) premiums  if you entered into an agreement with the Canada Employment Insurance Commission to have access to EI special benefits, such as maternity, parental, sickness or caregiving benefits  </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Income tax</li>
</ul>
<p>The self-employed individual is also responsible to file a T4A slip &ndash; Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity and Other Income.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Personal services business</summary>
<p>You may choose to incorporate; however, if you would normally be an employee if it were not for the existence of the corporation, the CRA will consider you a personal services business. This is sometimes referred to as an incorporated employee.</p>
<h4>Tax implications</h4>
<p>Personal services businesses are not entitled to income tax deductions available to other corporations, such as the small business deduction and the general rate reduction. Your corporation will be subject to the full federal and provincial tax rates on all taxable income. For 2018, the federal tax rate is 33%. In addition, personal services businesses cannot deduct most expenses available to other corporations. These types of expenses include things such as office supplies, travel expenses, meals, and cell phone costs. The only expenses that your corporation will be able to deduct are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The salary and wages the corporation pays to its incorporated employee(s) </li>
<li>Any benefit or allowance the corporation provides to its incorporated employee(s) </li>
<li>Legal expenses the corporation incurs for collecting amounts owing to it </li>
</ul>
<h4>Reporting</h4>
<p>All amounts paid to your corporation must be reported on T4A slips. </p>
<p>You will be responsible for filling out a T2 corporate income tax return for the personal services business in addition to a T1 personal income tax and benefit return as an individual. </p>
<p>Amounts paid by one business for services provided by another business are not subject to statutory payroll deductions. However, if you pay salary and wages to yourself from your corporation, or to another employee of your corporation, you will have to withhold income tax, CPP and, in some cases, EI. At the end of the year, the corporation will have to report the income paid to employees and the deductions on T4 slips. </p>
