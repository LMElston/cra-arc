<details><summary>Degree of control or independence</summary>
<p>Consider the degree of control held by the payer or the degree of independence held by the worker.</p>
<p>The actual degree of control will vary with the type of work and the skills of the worker.</p>
<p>Deciding the degree of control can be difficult when examining the employment of professionals such as engineers, doctors, and IT consultants. Because of their expertise and specialized training, they may need little or no specific direction in their daily activities. When examining the factor of control, it is necessary to focus on both the payer's control over the worker's daily activities and the payer's influence over the worker.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Payer's right to exercise control</summary>
<p>It is the right of the payer to exercise control that is relevant, <strong>not </strong>whether the payer actually exercises this right.</p>
<p>It is the control of a payer over a worker that is relevant and <strong>not </strong>the control of a payer over the end result of a product or service purchased.</p>

<h3> Tips </h3>
<p>Control is the ability, authority, or right of a hirer to exercise control over a worker concerning the manner in which the work is done and what work will be done. Combined with other factors, if the control factors suggests that the worker has a high degree of control, it may be an indication that the worker is an independent contractor. </p> 
<p>Specific to PSB: The degree of control exercised by the payer over the service provider’s duties (more control may indicate an employment relationship)</p>
<p>Specific to PSB: Providing similar services to other clients also indicates self-employment </p>

</li>

<li><h3 id="3"> Ownership of the tools and equipment</h3>
<p class="brdr-bttm">Consider if the worker owns and provides tools and equipment to accomplish the work. Contractual control of, and responsibility for, an asset in a rental or lease situation is also considered under this factor.</p>	
<details><summary>What is considered a significant investment</summary>
<p>What is relevant is the significant investment in the tools and equipment along with the cost of replacement, repair, and insurance. A worker who has made a significant investment is likely to retain a right over the use of these assets, diminishing the payer's control over how the work is carried out. In addition, such a significant investment may place the worker at a risk of a financial loss.</p>
<p>Tools and equipment can vary widely in terms of value and can include everything from wrenches and hammers, to specialized clothing, appliances, stethoscopes, musical instruments, computers, and vehicles such as trucks and tractors.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals often supply the tools and equipment required for a contract. As a result, the ownership of tools and equipment by a worker is more commonly associated with a business relationship.</p>
<p>However, employees sometimes also have to provide their own tools. The courts have acknowledged that because a worker is required to provide tools of the trade, this does not in itself mean that the worker is a self-employed individual. For example, many skilled tradespeople such as auto mechanics have to supply their own tools, even if they are full-time employees.</p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions the CRA may ask you to determine the status</summary>
<ul>
<li>What kind of tools and equipment are <strong>required </strong>for the worker to perform their service effectively? </li>
<li>Is it common in the industry for workers of either status to provide tools and equipment? </li>
<li>Did the payer provide any tools and equipment for the worker to use? If yes, did the payer charge the worker for the use of the tools and equipment provided? </li>
<li>What kind of tools and or equipment did the payer provide? </li>
<li>Did the worker provide any tools and equipment to perform their service? If yes, what kind of tools and equipment did the worker provide? </li>
<li>Is it a requirement or a preference of the worker to provide these tools and equipment? </li>
<li>What is the value of tools and equipment provided? </li>
<li>Who is responsible for the repair, replacement, maintenance and insurance of the tools and equipment? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The payer supplies most of the tools and equipment the worker needs. In addition, the payer is responsible for repair, maintenance, and insurance costs </li>
<li>The payer retains the right of use over the tools and equipment provided to the worker </li>
<li>The worker supplies the tools and equipment and the payer reimburses the worker for their use </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4 id="3a2" class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Indicators that the worker is self-employed  </h4>

<ul>
<li>The worker provides the tools and equipment needed for the work. In addition, the worker is responsible for the costs of repairs, insurance, and maintenance to the tools and equipment </li>
<li>The worker has made a significant investment in the tools and equipment and the worker retains the right over the use of these assets </li>
<li>The worker supplies their own workspace, is responsible for the costs to maintain it, and does substantial work from that site </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="brdr-bttm">Consider if the worker owns and provides tools and equipment to accomplish the work. Contractual control of, and responsibility for, an asset in a rental or lease situation is also considered under this factor.  </p>

<li><h3 id="5">Financial risk</h3>
<p class="brdr-bttm">Consider the degree of financial risk taken by the worker. Consider if there are any fixed ongoing costs incurred by the worker or any expenses that are not reimbursed.</p>
<details><summary>Employees will usually not have financial risks</summary>
<p>Usually, employees will not have any financial risk as any expenses will be reimbursed, and they will not have fixed ongoing costs.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals, on the other hand, can have financial risk and incur losses because they usually pay fixed monthly costs even if work is not currently being done.</p>
<p>Employees and self-employed individuals may be reimbursed for business or travel expenses. Therefore, focus on the expenses that are <strong>not </strong>reimbursed by the payer.</p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions the CRA may ask you to determine the status</summary>
<ul>
<li>Does the payer reimburse the worker for any expenses? Are these expenses reimbursed as part of negotiated benefits? </li>
<li>Does the worker have copies of any financial statements showing expenses related to their work? </li>
<li>Who covers the cost for travel expenses, benefits, vacation pay, and certain leaves? </li>
<li>Does the worker have any expenses that could be so substantial as to incur a business loss? </li>
<li>Does the worker have any expenses pertaining to the running of a business, for example: rent, advertising, business telephone, overhead? </li>
<li>How is the remuneration calculated? What does it include? Is the remuneration based on seniority? Is it based by the hour or by a lump sum? </li>
<li>Is the worker liable for any expenses if they cannot perform the work? </li>
<li>Can the worker look for work with other payers? </li>
<li>Can the worker hire any helpers or assistants to do some portions of their work? Who pays the helpers? If the worker hires the helpers, is the payer's approval necessary? </li>

<p class="brdr-bttm">Consider the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker. A significant investment is evidence that a business relationship may exist. You should also consider if the worker is free to make business decisions that affect their profit or loss.</p>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions the CRA may ask you to determine the status</summary>
<ul>
<li>Does the worker have an operating name? If yes, is it incorporated? If yes, you may need to provide a copy of the certificate of incorporation. </li>

<li><h3 id="7">Opportunity for profit</h3>
<p class="brdr-bttm">Consider whether the worker can realize a profit or incur a loss, as this indicates that a worker controls the business aspects of services rendered and that a business relationship likely exists. To have a chance of a profit and a risk of a loss, a worker has to have potential proceeds and expenses, and one could exceed the other.</p>
<details><summary>Consider this factor from the worker's perspective</summary>
<p>This factor has to be considered from the worker's perspective, not the payer's. It is for the most part an assessment of the degree to which the worker can control their proceeds and expenses.</p>
<p>Employees normally do not have the chance of a profit and risk of a loss even though their remuneration can vary depending on the terms of their employment contracts. For example, employees working on a commission or piece-rate basis, or employees with a productivity bonus clause in their contract can increase their earnings based on their productivity. This increase in income is not normally viewed as a profit, as it is not the excess of proceeds over expenses.</p>
<p>Employees may have expenses directly related to their employment, such as automobile expenses, and board and lodging costs. Normally, expenses would not place employees at risk of incurring a loss because it is unlikely that the expenses would be greater than their remuneration.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals normally have the chance of profit or risk of loss, because they have the ability to pursue and accept contracts as they see fit. They can negotiate the price (or unilaterally set their prices) for their services and have the right to offer those services to more than one payer. Self-employed individuals will normally incur expenses to carry out the terms and conditions of their contracts, and to manage those expenses to maximize net earnings. Self-employed individuals can increase their proceeds and/or decrease their expenses in an effort to increase profit.</p>
<p>Employees generally do not share in profits or suffer losses incurred by the payer's business.</p>
<p>The method of payment may help to decide if the worker has the opportunity to make a profit or incur a loss. In an employer-employee relationship, the worker is normally guaranteed a return for the work done and is usually paid on an hourly, daily, weekly, or similar basis.</p>
<p>Similarly, some self-employed individuals are paid on an hourly basis. However, when a worker is paid a flat rate for the work done, it generally indicates a business relationship, especially if the worker incurs expenses in doing the work.</p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions the CRA may ask you to determine the status</summary>
<ul>
<li>Is the work relationship continuous in nature, which is, is the work guaranteed? </li>
<li>Is the worker's compensation guaranteed as long as he or she works? </li>
<li>Is the worker paid a fixed amount for a specific end result with a deadline? What is the worker's rate of pay - hourly/weekly/piece work? </li>
<li>Is the worker financially liable if they do not fulfill the obligations of the contract, for example: the worker does not meet the deadline? </li>
<li>If the work performed has be redone due to errors or omissions, will the worker be compensated to redo the work? </li>
<li>Is the worker responsible for all expenses incurred in the performance of the work? </li>
<li>What kind of expenses is the worker responsible for?
<ul>
<li>tools and equipment </li>
<li>home office such as utilities, phone, computer, printer, supplies </li>
<li>vehicle </li>
<li>insurance </li>
<li>accounting and advertising fees </li>
