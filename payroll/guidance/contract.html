<p>Contracts can be formed either orally or in writing. An oral contract is as valid and enforceable as a written contract.</p>

<h4 id="h_0_3">Who decides when a contract is null and void</h4>
<p>When addressing the issue of statutory illegality, the courts can decide that a contract is null and void from the beginning (void ab initio) if the formation of the contract was prohibited by statute and if, in the court's assessment, it would not be contrary to public policy to declare the contract void ab initio.</p>
<h3 id="h_0_4">Cessation of a contract</h3>
<p>The conditions that can terminate a contract are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The death of one of the parties. </li>
<li>The expiry of the time stipulated for the duration of the contract by one of the following:
<ul>
<li>the parties </li>
<li>law, in the absence of any by the parties </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Confusion" arising as a result of both parties to the contract becoming one in the same (for example: an individual buys a business (sole proprietorship) that they have an existing contract with and becomes both parties to the same contract) </li>
<li>Misrepresentation </li>
<li>Fraud </li>
<li>Duress </li>
<li>The effect of a resolutory clause in the contract. This would be a clause in the contract that serves to release the parties to the contract from an obligation in the event of a stipulated occurrence or series of events.  </li>
<li>The disrespect of the main clauses of the contract, or significant breach of the conditions outlined in the contract. </li>
<li>A judgment from a competent court. </li>
<li>When the performance required by the contract becomes impossible for one or more of the parties to the contract to honour. Reasons such as a change in law making it illegal for one of the parties to meet their obligations, or the physical incapacity (injury or mental illness) of one or more of the parties can cause a contract to become impossible to honour. </li>
<li>When both the obligations and the consideration set out in the contract have been satisfied. In other words, once a contract is completed, it is at its cessation. </li>
</ul>
</div>
