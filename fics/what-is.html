<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">What is the AEOI</h1>


		<p>The Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) is a process whereby  tax information on residents who have accounts abroad is systematically and  periodically transmitted to the jurisdiction of tax residence. Under these  exchanges, the CRA sends information to partner jurisdictions and simultaneously  receives information regarding Canadian residents who hold financial accounts  offshore or abroad. The goal is to ensure tax transparency between countries  and to combat tax evasion.</p><p>
  While AEOI can cover various categories of income, including  dividends, interest, royalties, pensions etc.,  the focus of this webpage will be on the  automatic exchange of financial account information. </p><p>
  Canada participates in two automatic exchanges of financial  account information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) </li>
  <li>Common Reporting Standard (CRS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both FATCA and CRS require financial institutions to identify customers  who directly or indirectly hold financial accounts in jurisdictions where they  are not tax residents. Financial institutions are required to ask customers to disclose  their tax status and to submit documentation to support it.  </p>
<h2>What  is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)</h2>
<p>The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was enacted by the  U.S. government in March 2010. It is a law that requires non-U.S. financial  institutions to report to the U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS) any financial  accounts held or controlled by specified U.S. persons which include U.S.  citizens or residents.  </p><p>
  Recognising the legal and cost issues of this approach and the importance  of applying the underlying policy goal of FATCA on a reciprocal basis to  improve tax compliance the United States developed a model for the  intergovernmental implementation of FATCA. The Model provides for the  implementation of FATCA through reporting by financial institutions to their  local tax authorities, which then exchange the information on an automatic  basis with the U.S. tax authority.</p>
<p>The automatic exchange of financial account information with the  United States is governed by an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) signed by  Canada in 2014. The IGA was implemented through changes to PartXVIII,  Enhanced International Information Reporting, in the Income Tax Act, which set  out detailed requirements for Canadian financial institutions.</p><p>
  Under these exchanges, the CRA simultaneously receives similar  information from the IRS regarding Canadians who hold financial accounts in the  United States. </p>

<h2>What is the  Common Reporting Standard (CRS)</h2>
 <p> Developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) to combat cross-border tax evasion, the Common Reporting  Standard is an international standard for the collection, reporting and  exchange of financial account information. It requires financial institutions  to report to their tax administration any accounts held or controlled by  non-residents. Information is then exchanged with the jurisdiction where the  account holder is resident.</p><p>
  The CRS was implemented in Canada on December 15, 2016 under Part XIX  of the ITA and became effective on July 1, 2017. It requires Canadian financial  institutions to report account information to the CRA who in turn exchange this  information with partner jurisdictions under the provisions and safeguards of  the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters  or the relevant bilateral tax treaty. To date, more than 100 jurisdictions have  signed on to the CRS. </p>
