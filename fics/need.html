<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">What is needed from account holders</h1>
<p>In order for the CRA to complete exchanges of account information  with other jurisdictions, account holders may be asked to <strong>certify or clarify  their tax residence</strong> to their financial institution. Account holders who fail to  comply with such a request may have their financial account reported to the  CRA. </p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol class="lst-stps">
<li><h3>Know the types of account holders</h3>
<p>There are 2 types of account holders:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Individual account  holders</dt>
<dd>Any individuals who holds or want to open an account with a financial institution in Canada </dd>
<dt>Entitiy account  holders</dt>
<dd>Any corporation, trust, partnership, and other organizations (hereafter referred to as entities) that hold or want to open an account with Canadian financial institutions</dd>
</dl>
<li><h3>Self-certify</h3>
<p>A self-certification is a declaration by the account holder that  provides the account holder's identification details, tax residency, and any  other information that may reasonably be required by financial institutions to  fulfil its due diligence and reporting obligations.</p>
<p>A self-certification can be obtained verbally, electronically or on a  stand-alone document, or it can be part of a more comprehensive document used  by a financial institution in connection with the account opening as long as it  includes an element allowing the account holder to positively acknowledge by  signature or other means that the self-certification is valid. (For example,  the self-certification can be part of the account opening documentation.)</p>
<p>Financial  institutions must, upon request, allow account holders to have access to the  personal information that has been reported to the CRA.</p>




<div class="wb-tabs">
	<div class="tabpanels">
		<details id="details-panel1a">
		<summary>Self-certification of  individual account  holders</summary>
		
<p>If you are a new client at a financial institution, your financial  institution will ask you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To certify whether you are a non-resident of Canada or a U.S.  citizen when you open your account</li>
  <li>To provide documentation to support any representation you make</li>
</ul>
<p>Your financial institution will confirm the reasonableness of such  self-certification based on the information obtained.</p>
<p>For both existing and new accounts, if the information associated  with your account is later changed in a way that suggests you may be a  non-resident of Canada or a U.S. citizen (for example, you change your address  to an address outside Canada), your financial institution must take steps that  may include following up with you to verify your residence status.</p>
<p> The CRA has developed forms that financial institutions can use  for collecting the information required to determine the tax residency of the  account holder and of its controlling persons.   However, financial institutions are free to collect the information in  other ways, as long as they meet their reporting requirements.</p>
		<h4>Determining residence status for Canadian tax purposes</h4>
<p>Under Canada's tax system, income tax  obligations are based on your tax residence status. You need to know your tax  residence status before you can know what your tax responsibilities are.  Residents of Canada are taxable in Canada on their worldwide income whereas  non-residents are taxable in Canada on their income from Canadian sources. </p>
<p> Financial  institutions have to know the tax residence of their account holders to ensure  proper withholding and reporting. Therefore, financial institutions may ask  individuals to certify or clarify their residence status for Canadian tax  purposes. An  individual's tax residence status is determined on a case by case basis, based  on the individual's situation and all the relevant facts. The relevant facts in  determining your tax residence include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>residential       ties you have in Canada and abroad; and </li>
  <li>purpose       and permanence of your stay in Canada and abroad. </li>
</ul>
<p>Residential ties include social and  economic ties, such as a home, personal belongings, and family. </p>
<p> If you are an individual who normally  lives in Canada, files an income tax and benefit return as a resident of  Canada, and pays tax on worldwide income each year to Canada, you can inform  your financial institution that you are a resident of Canada for tax purposes.  However, even if you are a resident of Canada for tax purposes, if you are a  U.S. citizen, you must inform your financial institution that you are also a  U.S. citizen. </p>
<p> If you have no significant residential  ties with Canada and you have lived outside Canada during the year, you may be  considered a non-resident of Canada. </p>
<p> If you need help in determining your tax  residence status, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/determining-your-residency-status.html">Determining  your residency status</a></p>

<h4>Account holders with multiple residency</h4>
<p>If you are an individual who is considered a resident of Canada  and of another jurisdiction with which Canada has a tax treaty, you may take  into account the tie-breaker rules under the residence article of the relevant  tax treaty to determine your jurisdiction of residence. For example, you may  hold a green card (that is, a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.), in which  case the U.S. considers you to be a U.S. resident. If you are also a resident  of Canada for tax purposes and as a result of the tie-breaker rules under the  Canada–U.S. tax treaty you are considered a resident of Canada and do not hold  U.S. citizenship, you can inform your financial institution that you are a  resident of Canada and not a resident of the U.S. However, if you are a U.S.  citizen, you must inform your financial institution that you are also a U.S.  citizen unless you have relinquished your U.S. citizenship. Financial  institutions may ask individuals who have relinquished their U.S. citizenship  for documentation to this effect</p>
<p>If you are an individual who is  considered a resident of Canada and of another jurisdiction with which Canada  does not have a tax treaty, you must inform your financial institution that you  are a resident of both jurisdictions for tax purposes. Refer to: <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/treatystatus_-eng.asp">Canada's tax  treaties</a></p>

		<summary>Self-certification of entity account  holders</summary>
<p>Financial institutions have to know the tax status of account  holders and others they deal with.  </p>
<p> If you are a new client at a financial institution, your financial  institution will ask you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To certify whether you are a non-resident entity, the type of  entity you are and whether you are an entity controlled by one or more  non-residents or U.S. citizens when you open the account</li>
  <li>To provide documentation to support any representation you make</li>
</ul>
<p>Your financial institution will confirm the reasonableness of such  self-certification based on the information obtained.</p>
<p> For both existing and new accounts, if the information associated  with your account is later changed in a way that suggests you may be a  non-resident of Canada or a specified U.S. person (for example, you change your  address to an address outside Canada) or if there is any addition,  substitution, or other change to your account or a controlling person such as a  new administrator, a new major shareholder or a distribution to a discretionary  beneficiary, or any change or addition of information to any account associated  with your account if such change or addition of information affects the status  of your account, your financial institution must take steps that may include  following up with you to verify your residence status or requesting a  self-certification. </p>
<p> The CRA has developed forms that financial institutions can use  for collecting the information required to determine the tax residency of the  account holder and of its controlling persons. However, financial institutions  are free to collect the information in other ways, as long as they meet their  reporting requirements.</p>

<li><h3>Be aware of information sharing practices</h3>
<p>Designed to improve tax compliance, the two AEOI regimes (FATCA and CRS) require Canadian financial institutions to collect certain information from their account holders.</p>
<div class="wb-tabs">
	<div class="tabpanels">
		<details id="details-panel1">
			<summary>How financial instituations report on individual account  holders</summary>
			<p>Financial institutions have to report most bank accounts, mutual  funds, brokerage accounts, custodial accounts, annuity contracts (including  segregated fund contracts), and some life insurance policies with a cash value  that are held by non-residents of Canada or U.S. citizens.</p>
<p> Certain accounts are <strong>not</strong> reportable, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>registered retirement savings plans </li>
  <li>registered retirement income funds </li>
  <li>pooled registered pension plans </li>
  <li>registered pension plans </li>
  <li>tax-free savings accounts </li>
  <li>registered disability savings plans </li>
  <li>registered education savings plans </li>
  <li>deferred profit-sharing plans </li>
</ul>



<p>Due  diligence procedures require financial institutions to identify account holders  who are non-residents of Canada or U.S. citizens. As an individual account  holder, you may be asked to certify or clarify your tax residence to your  financial institution.  This is done by  asking accounts holders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To declare whether they are non-residents of Canada or U.S.  citizens</li>
  <li>To produce documents such as a driver's licence for any  representation they make</li>
</ul>
<p>The CRA gives the information it receives  from financial institutions on U.S. residents and U.S. citizens to the U.S.  government while other non-resident information is sent to CRS partner  jurisdictions. In return, the U.S. government and CRS partner jurisdictions  provide the CRA with similar information on Canadian residents holding financial  accounts with financial institutions located in their jurisdictions. The  agreements are strictly information-sharing and do not involve any new or  higher taxes. The sharing of information has no effect on foreign filing or  reporting requirements. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Intergovernmental Agreement for the Enhanced Exchange of Financial  Account Information under the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention </li>
  <li>Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information  in Tax Matters </li>
</ul>
<p>Account holders who fail to comply with such a request may have  their financial account reported to the CRA.  Information is then sent to either the U.S.  government or the jurisdiction in which the account holder or controlling  person appears to be a resident of. Safeguards are in place to ensure that the  U.S. and CRS partners treat the taxpayer information they receive as  confidential and that it is used solely to administer tax laws. </p>


<h3>Information reported to the CRA and shared with the U.S. or CRS partner</h3>
<p>The account information that is collected and shared with the U.S.  or the CRS partner includes:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Name </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Address</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Jurisdiction of residence </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Date of birth (in some circumstances)</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Account number, account balance or value, and amounts paid or  credited to the account</li>
</ul>
<p>If a financial institution identifies a joint account as a  reportable account, it will report the full value of the account to the CRA. It  will not report identifying information (name, address, and taxpayer  identification number) associated with joint account holders who are not  non-residents of Canada or U.S. citizens.</p>
<p> Although financial institutions do not have to notify their  account holders that their financial account information has been reported to  the CRA, they must be open about their policies and procedures on reporting  obligations and must be prepared to make this information available to anyone  who asks by allowing account holders to have access to the personal information  that has been reported. </p>
<p> As an account holder, you can also contact the CRA to find out if  your information has been received or shared with the U.S. or your jurisdiction  of residence.</p>

			<summary>How financial instituations report on entitiy account  holders</summary>
			
		

		 

<p>Due diligence procedures require financial  institutions to identify entity account holders that are either specified U.S.  persons or reportable persons, or are controlled by U.S. residents or citizens  or non-residents. This is done by asking for and reviewing information from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>account holders </li>
  <li>account records and/or</li>
  <li>publicly available sources </li>
</ul>
<p>In order to meet their tax reporting  obligations with the CRA, Canadian financial institutions require certain  information about entity account holders. Financial institutions have to  determine: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Where       an entity is <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#Residence_status">resident</a> for       tax purposes</li>

</ul>
<p>Once received by the CRA, this financial  information is shared with the partner jurisdictions. </p>
<p> All of Canada's bilateral tax treaties  contain robust safeguards to ensure that the U.S. and CRS partners treat the  taxpayer information they receive as confidential and that it is used solely to  administer tax laws. In addition, both the U.S. government and CRS partner  jurisdiction reciprocate by sending the CRA similar information on Canadian  entities and entities controlled by Canadian residents holding accounts with  financial institutions located in their jurisdictions. </p>
<p> Account information that is shared  includes the entity's: </p>
<ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-md">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Name </li>

  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Account number, account balance or value, and amounts paid or  credited to the account</li>
</ul>
<p>In  the case of an entity that is a non-financial entity (or a non-financial  foreign entity) that, after application of the due diligence procedures is  identified as having one or more controlling persons that is a non-resident or  a specified U.S. person, information that is shared includes the controlling  person's: </p>

<h4>Entities that are reportable</h4>
	<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Residence status</dt><dd>
<p> Generally, an entity will be a tax resident of a jurisdiction  if, under the laws of that jurisdiction, it pays or should be paying tax there  because of its domicile, residence, place of management or incorporation, or  any other similar criterion. An entity will generally be considered resident:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if it is a corporation, in the jurisdiction where it is  incorporated</li>
  <li>if it is a trust, in the jurisdiction where its place of  management and control is located</li>
  <li>if it is a partnership, a limited partnership, or a similar legal  arrangement, in the jurisdiction where its place of management is located</li>
</ul>
<p>For  more information see:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Residency of a corporation </li>
  <li>Residency of a trust or estate </li>
</ul>
	</dd>
<dt>U.S.  person</dt><dd>
<p> Generally  speaking, an entity is a U.S. person if it is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a corporation or partnership organized in the U.S.</li>
  <li>a trust subject to U.S. law that is controlled by one or more U.S.  citizens or U.S. residents, for tax purposes</li>
  <li>a testamentary trust of a deceased person who was a U.S. citizen  or a U.S. resident, for tax purposes at the time of death</li>
</ul>
<p>A corporation  that was incorporated in Canada, or organized in any other jurisdiction outside  of the U.S., is not generally a U.S. person.</p>
<p> For  more information see:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/classification-of-taxpayers-for-us-tax-purposes">Classification  of Taxpayers for U.S. Tax Purposes </a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Specified U.S. person</dt><dd>
<p> An  entity that is a U.S. person is not a specified U.S. person if it is a  corporation whose stock is regularly traded on an established securities  market, or if it is a U.S. agency or government. A specified U.S. person also  does not include most entities that fall into any of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a trust or organization exempt from tax</li>
  <li>a bank, real estate investment trust, regulated investment  company, common trust fund, or securities or commodities dealer</li>
  <li>a corporation that is related to a corporation whose stock is  publicly traded</li>
</ul>
<p>If an entity  falls in one of the foregoing categories, it should consult the definition of  specified U.S. person in subparagraph 1(ff) of Article 1 of the <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/pdf/FATCA-eng.pdf">Intergovernmental Agreement for the  Enhanced Exchange of Financial Account Information under the Canada-U.S. Tax  Convention</a> to determine if it can certify that it is not a specified  U.S. person.</p>
		</dd>
<dt>Financial  institution</dt><dd>
<p> An entity  that holds an account at a financial institution in Canada may be asked to  declare whether it is a financial institution. Accounts held by an entity that  is a financial institution are generally not reportable.</p>
<p> To be a  financial institution, an entity must be a custodial institution, a depository  institution, an investment entity, or a specified insurance company that offers  insurance contracts with an investment component or annuity contracts. </p>
<p> An entity  resident in Canada that is a financial institution must determine whether it is  a Canadian financial institution, when completing a self-certification form. An  entity resident in Canada that is not a Canadian financial institution is a  non-financial entity (NFE) or a non-financial foreign entity (NFFE) unless it  is prescribed as a non-reporting financial institution. This entity has to  identify itself as an active or passive NFE/NFFE. An entity that is prescribed  as a non-reporting financial institution can identify itself as a financial  institution, even if it is not a Canadian financial institution</p>
<p> Listed FI – A  person whose principal business is lending money to related corporations or  purchasing debt securities from related corporations or a combination thereof  is a listed financial institution.</p>

		</dd>
<dt>Types  of investment entities</dt><dd>
<p> An entity  that holds an account at a financial institution in Canada may be asked whether  it is an investment entity in a non-participating jurisdiction, if it is  managed by another financial institution. If that is the case, and at least 50%  of its gross income is from investing or trading in financial assets, it will  be considered a passive non-financial entity.</p>

<dt>Non-financial entity</dt><dd>
<p> All  entities resident in Canada are non-financial entities (NFEs) if they are not  Canadian financial institutions while all entities that are not resident in  Canada are NFEs if they are not financial institutions.</p>
<p> Example:</p>
<p> Bill is a  carpenter whose business (entity) is incorporated in Canada. Since Bill's  entity is not a financial institution, it is an NFE. </p>
		</dd>
<dt>Non-financial  foreign entity</dt><dd>

<p> All entities  resident in Canada are non-financial foreign entities (NFFEs) if they are not Canadian  financial institutions while all non-U.S. entities are NFFEs if they are not  financial institutions.</p>
<p> The agreement  with the U.S. uses the term non-financial foreign entity (NFFE), while the  CRS uses the term non-financial entity (NFE). For the purposes of the CRS,  a U.S. entity that is not a financial institution is an NFE, and unless  specifically stated, the term NFE has the same meaning throughout  this document.</p>
		</dd>
<dt>Active  non-financial entity</dt><dd>
<p> An entity  that carries on an active trade or business is generally an active  non-financial entity (active NFE). An active NFE also includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a public       corporation with shares that regularly trade on an established securities       exchange (for example, the Toronto Stock Exchange or the New York Stock       Exchange)</li>
  <li>an       entity related to a public corporation (as described in the first bullet)</li>
  <li>a       government (or an agency or its instrumentality thereof) that performs       functions of a governmental nature</li>
  <li>a       non-profit organization that is exempt from tax</li>
</ul>
<p>A Canadian  corporation that is dedicated only to running a restaurant, hair salon, car  dealership, or factory is engaged in an active pursuit and is an active NFE. On  the other hand, a personal investment corporation or trust that holds  investments to produce passive income will not be an active NFE.</p>
<p> A business corporation or other entity can be involved in multiple  activities or hold a combination of assets, which may make it more difficult to  know whether it should be categorized as an active NFE. For example, a  corporation may be carrying on an active business, but also earning significant  income from portfolio holdings. It is an active NFE as long as the entity earned  less than 50% of its gross income in its last fiscal year from passive income;  and less than 50% of its assets held during that year were held to generate  passive income (the passive income/asset test).</p>
<p> Passive income is generally understood to include income from the  holding of investment property, such as interest, dividends, and rent.</p>
<p> Example:</p>
<p> Michele is a professional photographer and her business is  incorporated as ABC Photo in Alberta. She is the one shareholder of the  corporation. In its last fiscal year, 70% of ABC Photo's income was from fees  and commissions, and 30% was from passive income in the form of interest and  dividends from assets owned by ABC Photo, which represent 25% of its total  assets.</p>
<p> ABC Photo is an active NFE.</p>
		</dd>
<dt>Passive  non-financial entity</dt><dd>
<p>Entities that  do not engage in substantive business activities to produce a good or service  and that are not active NFEs are generally passive NFEs.</p>
<p> Under the CRS, an entity that is an investment entity in a  non-participating jurisdiction, managed by another financial institution and  for whom at least 50% of its gross income is from investing or trading in  financial assets, is considered a passive NFE.</p>
<p> Example:</p>
<p> Joe is an  optometrist whose practice is incorporated in Quebec. He is the sole shareholder  of the corporation. He is preparing to retire and has reduced the number of  hours he works. So the portfolio owned by the corporation now earns more income  from investment assets than from fees for service. As reported for the last  fiscal year, 40% of the corporation's income was from fees and 60% was passive  income from investment assets.</p>
<p> Joe's  corporation is a passive NFE.</p>
		</dd>
<dt>Active  or passive NFE, or NFFE</dt><dd>
<p> An entity may  need more information to determine if it is an active or a passive NFE, or  NFFE. Before certifying its status, an entity should check the definitions of  passive and active NFE in subsection 270(1) of the Income Tax Act and of  active and passive NFFE in Section VI, Annex I, of the<a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/pdf/FATCA-eng.pdf"> Intergovernmental Agreement for  the Enhanced Exchange of Financial Account Information under the Canada-U.S.  Tax Convention</a>, respectively. </p>
<p> The  distinction between active and passive NFE or NFFE is important. If an account  holder is a passive NFE, the financial institution must identify all of the  holder's controlling persons who are non-residents of Canada. If the account  holder is a passive NFFE, the financial institution must identify all of the  holder's controlling persons who are U.S. residents or U.S. citizens.</p>
<p> For the  purposes of reporting a financial account of a passive NFE or NFFE, a financial  institution is required to collect additional information in respect of the  entity's controlling persons. As such, a financial institution that maintains  an account of an entity controlled by a non-resident of Canada or a U.S.  citizen may be required to report that controlling person's date of  birth and taxpayer identification number (TIN) associated with such  jurisdiction of tax residence when reporting information to the CRA. If the  controlling person is a non-resident of Canada or a U.S. citizen, they must  provide the date of birth and TIN to the financial institution when it asks for  it. For U.S. residents and U.S. citizens, the TIN is generally the U.S. social  security number. Note that if the controlling person has a Canadian social  insurance number (SIN), it must also be provided to the financial institution.</p>

<dt>Controlling  persons</dt><dd>
<p> The  term controlling persons of an entity means the individuals who have  direct or indirect control over the entity. Generally, whether an individual has control over an entity is  determined by how beneficial owners are identified in the PCMLTFA, as well as  the ownership thresholds set by Canadian financial regulatory authorities.</p>
<p> For a  corporation, an individual is considered to be controlling if they directly or  indirectly own or control 25% or more of the corporation. If no individual is  identified as controlling the corporation through ownership interests or voting  rights, the controlling person(s) of the corporation is the individual(s) who  exercises control of the corporation through other means, such as the  directors. If no individual(s) is identified as exercising control of the  corporation either through ownership interests, voting rights or other means,  the controlling person(s) of the corporation is the individual(s) who holds the  position of senior managing official, e.g., a CEO of the corporation.</p>
<p> For a trust,  the controlling persons include its settlors, trustees, protectors (if any),  beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries, and any other individuals having  ultimate effective control over the trust. A person is treated as a beneficiary  if they have the right to receive, directly or indirectly, a mandatory  distribution; or they receive, directly or indirectly, a discretionary  distribution from the trust. In the case of discretionary distributions, the  beneficiary may only be treated as a beneficiary in the calendar year in which  they receive a distribution.</p>
<p> Where a  controlling person of an entity account that is a passive NFE is an entity,  then for purposes of determining the passive NFE's controlling persons, one has  to look through the chain of control or ownership of that entity to identify  the individual(s) having ultimate effective control over the entity and to report  them as the controlling persons of the passive NFE. </p>
<p> In the case  where the control or ownership of the passive NFE is a trust, and the trust  directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the passive NFE, the trust  would be required to report all individuals who are controlling the trust. In  the case where the control or ownership of the passive NFE is a corporation,  and the corporation directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the  passive NFE, the authorized signing officer would be required to report all of  the individuals who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the  corporation.</p>
<p> For a legal  arrangement other than a trust, controlling persons are individuals in  equivalent or similar position as in a trust who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more  of the legal arrangement and where the control is exercised through other means  than ownership, the control persons are the persons in equivalent or similar  positions as in a trust.</p>

</ul>
		</dd>
<dt>Types  of controlling persons</dt><dd>
<p> A financial  institution can ask an individual to describe the type of controlling person  they are. The financial institution has to identify if the individual is  controlling the entity by way of ownership interests, voting rights or by other  means. If no individual can be identified as controlling the entity by way of  ownership interests, voting rights or other means, the entity account holder  must report the senior managing official as the controlling person. For a  trust, the financial institution has to identify who the controlling person is:  the settlor, the trustee, the protector, or a beneficiary. For other legal  arrangements such as a partnership, the financial institution has to identify  the controlling person as: the equivalent of a settlor, trustee, protector,  beneficiary of the partnership, or other legal arrangements.</p>
