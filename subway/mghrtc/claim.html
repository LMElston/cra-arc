            <h2 id="h-1">Claim on the tax return</h2>
            <p>For 2023 and subsequent taxation years the MGHRTC can be claimed on the T1 income tax and benefit return, line BBBBBBBBBB.</p>
			<p>The person who makes the claim is ZZZZZZZZZ.</p>
			<p>You only make the claim <strong>once</strong>. The claim is made in the taxation year that the renovation period ends.<p>
			<details><summary>Example: Renovation ends in 2024</summary><p>Regardless of when the renovations stared, it can only be claimed in the year it ended. In a situation where the renovation is done is 2024 means that the claim is made on the 2024 tax return.</p>

                    <summary>Example: If an expense has already been claimed</summary>
                  
    

    
        <p>Expenses are not eligible for the to be claimed more than once.  For example, if the expense was already claimed under the medical expense tax credit (METC) or the home accessibility tax credit (HATC), you cannot claim it under the Multigenerational home renovation tax credit (MGHRTC).</p>
